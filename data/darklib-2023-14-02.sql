(1, 'Intelligence', 'mental', 'power', 'The raw power of the mind. Cognitive capacity. The inherent capability to digest, comprehend and remember information — and to learn more. Intelligence is a direct measure of how smart your character is. She may be dull-minded or have narrow-vision. She may be book-smart, or she may simply be able to grasp concepts, interpret situations and solve problems quickly. Intelligence is valued by planners, theorists, scholars, white-collar employees and leaders.', '“I’m sick of this,” Becky announced in frustration. She immediately regretted her outburst as her words echoed throughout the musty old library. Fortunately, this late at night, even during exams, no one else was there to hear. She had been working on her thesis for weeks without getting anywhere. Once again, she wondered if a degree in Linguistics was a good choice.\r\n\r\nHer research was simply not panning out as she hoped, but after another pep talk, she forced herself back into the stacks. What other choice did she have? It was when reaching for a book on Sanskrit that she made her real discovery. A dusty old volume that seemed to have fallen between bookcases. It was bound in leather — or something like it — and had no publication date. Indeed, the book was nothing like she had ever seen before. No end papers. No table of contents. It just launched into some strange text.\r\n\r\nThe next thing she knew, Becky had passed hours studying the book. It had characters reminiscent of Latin and Greek, yet different, with odd pictographs throughout. As near as she could tell, it was dedicated to a religion or to ceremonies of some kind, but from what culture she had no idea. She did know that if she was ever going to find out, she would need more time with it.', 'intelligence'),
(2, 'Wits', 'mental', 'finesse', 'The ability to think on one’s feet, under pressure or duress, without letting them see you sweat. W its also encompasses an eye for detail, the ability to absorb what’s going on in the environment, and to react to events. It might mean recognizing that the temperature in a room slowly drops, that a landscape painting incorporates a disguised human face, or that a trap is about to be sprung. Wits involves the powers of perception and response. Your character may be oblivious, dumbfounded, quick-eyed or wary. The trait is useful for entrepreneurs, charlatans, athletes, tacticians, lawyers and criminals.', 'Martin had accepted some weird jobs, but this one took the cake. He’d installed or repaired plumbing across the city. He liked the work; jobs could be challenging and fun. Busting open drywall and messing with pipes was like tinkering with the skeleton of a building. You got to see straight into people’s private worlds. Sometimes you even got to peek at the skeletons in their closets. \r\n\r\nBut why be hired to do a full re-pipe at this place and be told not to go on the top floor? Martin had to know. So, when the greasy guy who hired him caught him at the top of the stairs, Martin had to think fast.\r\n\r\n“Yeah, I tried to find you. It’s uh... it’s what I was afraid of. An old building like this, the fittings have given way from wood rot or something. We’re, uh... we’re gonna need to re-route all the pipes upstairs instead of running the same lines.”\r\n\r\nDamn, that was good, he thought. Might be able to squeeze some extra bucks out of this job. The other man didn’t seem convinced.', 'wits'),

Resolve is your character’s mental fortitude. His personal conviction. His clarity of vision or spirit. Your character may be easily distracted, unable to concentrate, resolute or single-minded. The trait is pivotal to resisting supernatural forms of mental control; it acts as a veritable defense of the mind. Resolve is valuable to leaders, motivators, soldiers, athletes, police and organizers.\r\n\r\n(Note: Resolve is not to be confused with Willpower. Resolve is your character’s ongoing focus. Think of it as his long-term purpose, like a career plan. Willpower reflects your character’s short-term highs and lows, his ability to dedicate himself in brief efforts to overcome challenges. Resolve does contribute to your character’s Willpower dots, though)', 'Josh only really came to his senses when he threw up in the toilet. He had been conscious the whole time, he knew, but it was like he’d been in a daze, walking around like a zombie. He thought back to how it all happened. He’d left his apartment a few hours ago to run errands. It was a nice enough day for winter. He’d gotten some groceries, and then...\r\n\r\nAll he could remember was a blur. Something was there. Big. Strange. He remembered eyes, like an animal’s. They stared straight into his soul in a weird, almost primitive way. It was like his lizard brain kicked in and told him to run and hide, like a rabbit under the shadow of a hawk.\r\n\r\nJosh had a fleeting glimpse of the oranges he’d just bought rolling across the sidewalk, and then all he knew was being back in his apartment, getting sick. How did he get there? Why did he come back? How come he couldn’t remember? And what was that thing? Josh wasn’t sure, but he wasn’t content to let it go, either.\r\n', 'resolve'),

Your character could be 98-pound weakling, he could carry a spare tire, or he could be lean and cut or bulky and brawny. Your character’s Strength score is used in hand-to-hand combat. This trait is instrumental to laborers, thugs, athletes, brawlers and law-enforcement agents.\n\nStrength, along with Dexterity, is a factor in determining your character’s Speed.\n\nStrength is also added to Brawl or Weaponry attacks to determine the amount of harm your character inflicts in combat.', '“God damn,” Martin grunted as he pulled on the drain cover in the basement. Somehow, water was still backing up in the system. Everything else checked out, so it had to be a clog in the outtake to the sewer.\r\n\r\nThe building was so old that it still had a dirt-floor basement, yet the drain cover was stuck like a son of a bitch.\r\n\r\n“I could dig around it,” Martin thought, “but that would take time.” This was the last place he wanted to be pulling late hours. The whole building and the guy who hired him really gave him the creeps. It was like the guy resented Martin being there, as if the plumber was intruding on something the guy wanted for himself.\r\n\r\n“Fuck it,” Martin thought, and went to his truck to get a crowbar. Jamming it between grilles, he pried with everything he had. He pushed so hard he thought he was going to piss himself, when the cover cracked loose with a clang.\r\n\r\nAiming his flashlight down the hole, Martin saw something he couldn’t explain.

While high Wits dots helps your character spot trouble, high Dexterity dots help him react to it, whether with a counteraction or to simply get the hell out of the way. Dexterity also helps with hand-eye coordination, be it to fire an accurate shot, to juggle objects or to perform delicate jobs such as handle explosives. Your character might be sluggish, clumsy, slight, quick or nimble. Dexterity is invaluable to criminals, sports stars, surgeons and dancers.\r\n\r\nDexterity, along with Strength, is a factor in determining your character’s Speed.\r\n\r\nDexterity is also combined with Composure to determine your character’s Initiative in a fight.', 'Josh had retraced his steps back to where he fell, to where he saw that thing. He turned on the sidewalk, surveying his neighborhood. It wasn’t the best place to live, but he couldn’t afford any better. The worst of it was the bums and homeless, but they left him alone if he gave them some change.\r\n\r\nJosh snapped out of his daydream and realized that he’d been staring glassy-eyed at the alley across the street. There was something about it. He shook his head to clear it and waited for a couple cars to pass.\r\n\r\nThe alley lay between rundown tenements and ran past an old parking lot. No one parked there anymore. Cardboard boxes and scattered blankets used by bums blocked the way. Josh almost turned back, not wanting to piss off the street people, but then he remembered how angry he got back home.\r\n\r\nHe steeled himself and headed down the alley. Almost immediately, open hands reached out from what looked like heaps of trash or discarded clothing as the homeless muttered for money. After a moment, their pleas turned to angry shouts as Josh ventured further into their territory. Panicking, Josh jumped up the chain-link fence next to him. It was the closest escape route. He wished he hadn’t when he got to the barbwire at the top, but forced himself upward and over. He didn’t quite make it, and the rusted steel tore through his pants and into his leg.', 'dexterity'),
(6, 'Stamina', 'physical', 'resistance', 'Sturdiness. Steadfastness. Sheer physical resilience. Stamina is a measure of how tough your character is. It indicates how far she can push her body, and how much physical abuse she can endure. Your character might be sickly and frail, or hardy and unstoppable. Bouncers, brawlers, triathletes, survivalists, heavy lifters and workaholics thrive on Stamina.\r\n\r\nStamina, along with Size, is a factor in determining your character’s Health dots.', 'Becky thanked the pizza guy absently as she closed her apartment door. His nose wrinkled in distaste, not because she failed to tip him but because of the smell of her room, because of her greasy hair and because of her clearly unwashed appearance.\r\n\r\nBecky never noticed the silent insult. She hadn’t really noticed anything for weeks. In fact, eating had become something that she had to remind herself to do. Now it was the book that consumed her. Even as she pushed aside scattered and wadded up papers to sit down, she kept her nose in the book. It demanded every ounce of her attention. Translating and understanding it had become her obsession. It superceded sleep, food, even her thesis. At first, she hoped the book would be invaluable to her research. Now she pored over it for its own sake. If she kept studying, kept interpreting. She knew comprehension would come. As the night wore on, Becky continued to work.

Your character may be jaw-dropping gorgeous, plain-Jane or downright ugly, but her Presence means much more. It reflects her sheer command over the attention of others. It’s her capacity to impose her will on others by being socially aggressive or powerful — a veritable bull in a china shop or someone who simply doesn’t accept no for an answer. This trait is essential to leaders, enforcers, interrogators, models, politicians and salespeople.\r\n\r\nNote that attractiveness alone is represented by the Striking Looks Merit, which grants bonus dice to Presence rolls.', 'Martin was stunned. He wasn’t sure how long he stared at the blood on his hand, bewildered by what it might mean. Was the guy who owned the place some kind of psycho, killing people and pouring their blood down the drain? He wasn’t sure, but he finally decided that he didn’t want to find out. It was weird, though. It was like he couldn’t think straight. This should have scared the shit out of him, and here he was kind of out of it, like he’d had a few.\r\n\r\nWhen he got upstairs, he realized the lights were on. It was already dusk outside, given the last light coming in through the windows. “When did that happen,” he wondered. “I meant to—” \r\n\r\nHis thought went unfinished. Standing before him at the foot of the stairs was the most beautiful woman he’d ever seen. Normally, he didn’t go for brunettes. They reminded him of his ex-, but somehow this one made it work. Did she ever. \r\n\r\n“What was I doing?” Martin muttered, but no answer came.\r\n\r\nThe woman’s dark eyes contrasted her pale skin, and focused intently on the blood on Martin’s hand, on the blood that he’d absently smeared across his shirt.\r\n\r\n“Did you hurt yourself?” the woman asked. “Here, let me make it better.”\r\n', 'presence'),
(8, 'Manipulation', 'social', 'finesse', 'Charm. Persuasiveness. Charisma. The capacity to play upon the desires, hopes and needs of others to influence them. Manipulation reflects your character’s finesse in social situations. How well he can appeal to, gain the favor of and generally coerce others. Manipulation is applied to win smiles, to put people at ease or to gain favors. Where Presence deals in social force, Manipulation focuses on social subtlety. It’s the tool and trade of businesspeople, politicians, salesfolk and publicists. Your character may be a wallflower, he could frequently make off-color statements, he might have a winning smile and a hardy handshake, or he may be able to sell sand in the desert.', '“What the fuck am I doing?” Josh wondered as he picked his way down the trash-strewn hallway. “This is exactly where I didn’t want to go.”\r\n\r\nHe had evaded the homeless people in the alley, but then had nowhere to go except into one of the old tenements. His leg burned from the long scratches the fence left him. He hoped his tetanus shot was up to date; he couldn’t remember. The place smelled like piss. He could hear music blaring somewhere, and a baby crying. “Who could raise a kid here?” he wondered.\r\n\r\nHe didn’t have time to think about the answer, though. His eyes were suddenly drawn from the stained carpet to the light at the end of the hall. Three shapes filled it. Two more turned the corner behind him. They were the people from outside. Maybe they weren’t so homeless, after all.\r\n\r\nOn the verge of panic once again, Josh recognized one of the men. “Hey, Eddy, it’s me, Josh. What’s going on?”\r\n\r\nThe five dirty, disheveled men stopped a few feet away, with menacing looks on their faces. “What are you doing here, Josh?” Eddy asked. “I was looking for somethi— a guy. I thought I saw him go in here. Maybe you could help me find him? I think I got a couple bucks....”\r\n\r\n“We don’t want your fucking money.” For a second, Josh wondered if he saw that same bestial look that he’d seen earlier that day — but this time in Eddy’s eyes.', 'manipulation'),
(9, 'Composure', 'social', 'resistance', 'Poise. Dignity. The capacity to remain calm and appear — and actually be — unfazed in social and threatening situations, usually harrowing ones. Your character might lose his temper at the slightest perceived insult, collapse emotionally under a mere pretense, weather a storm of verbal (or literal) slings and arrows, or have the nerve to look unspeakable horror in the eye. This trait is a measure of emotional fortitude, restraint and calm. It’s ideal among leaders, soldiers, moderators and anyone whose movements are public consumption. Composure is vital to resisting social influence and pressure — overt, covert or otherworldly.\r\n\r\nComposure is pivotal to resisting supernatural forms of emotional control; it acts as a veritable emotional defense. The trait is also vital to efforts among supernatural beings such as vampires and werewolves to restrain themselves when their blood is raised and frenzy threatens.\r\n\r\nComposure, along with Resolve, is a factor in determining your character’ s Willpower.\r\n\r\nComposure is also added to Dexterity to determine your character’s Initiative at the beginning of a fight.', '“Do you understand now?” the priest asked.\r\n\r\nBecky was in shock. Moments before, she’d stormed to her door, ready to unleash her frustration on whomever had dared to interrupt her. Her research had not gone well. The meaning or purpose of the book still eluded her, and she was at the end of her rope.\r\n\r\nOnce she recovered sufficiently from the shock of finding a priest at her door, she answered. “What?”\r\n\r\n“Do you understand now? About the book? About what it says?” Becky continued her look of disbelief. How could this perfect stranger — and a man of the cloth — know anything about her, or more importantly the book?\r\n\r\n“I see,” he continued as he let himself in and shut the door.\r\n\r\nBecky didn’t object. She could scarcely complete a thought.\r\n\r\n“You might be confused. I understand. Rest assured, though, you’re the one. The book chose you. It knows you’re ready. Well, almost. That’s why I’m here. I’m here to help open your eyes.” And with that, everything Becky had stared at and studied moved about in her mind like the pieces of a puzzle. They spun, crisscrossed and overlapped — and finally formed a complete picture. Looking at it was like looking at the sun. It was like staring into the void and knowing that the void stared back. In that moment, Becky’s mind snapped.', 'composure');

How could this perfect stranger — and a man of the cloth — know anything about her, or more importantly the book?\n\n“I see,” he continued as he let himself in and shut the door.\n\nBecky didn’t object. She could scarcely complete a thought.\n\n“You might be confused. I understand. Rest assured, though, you’re the one. The book chose you. It knows you’re ready. Well, almost. That’s why I’m here. I’m here to help open your eyes.” And with that, everything Becky had stared at and studied moved about in her mind like the pieces of a puzzle. They spun, crisscrossed and overlapped — and finally formed a complete picture. Looking at it was like looking at the sun. It was like staring into the void and knowing that the void stared back. In that moment, Becky’s mind snapped.');

Only rarely do our experiences draw back the veil of shadows and reveal the horror in our midst.

Only a few, however, can overcome their fear and dare to look deeper.\n\n**Abandon Hope All Who Enter**\n\nThe **World of Darkness Rulebook** introduces a version of our contemporary world where the supernatural is real. Players join to tell tales of mystery and horror, where theme, mood and plot are more important to a character’s experiences than his weapons or equipment. Inside are rules for character creation, task resolution, combat and any activity your character attempts as he delves into the shadows.', 1),

Enfant brillante elle s’épanouit entourée de l\'amour de ses parents et d\'amis.\n\nCependant son train-train quotidien prit brusquement fin le 18 juin 1994 lorsque ses parents furent retrouvés assassinés dans leur voiture. Le meurtre du procureur et de sa femme provoquèrent un violent battage médiatique et la police déploya des ressources considérable afin d\'élucider l\'affaire.\n\n> ==== EXTRAIT DU RAPPORT DE POLICE ====\n> \n> La famille Sanders revenait d\'une soirée au cinéma Prytania dans lequel la famille avait ses habitudes.

A l\'arrivée des agents ils constatèrent que monsieur et madame Sanders avaient été violemment agressés à l\'aide d\'une arme blanche; vraisemblablement une machette. Le véhicule semblait à l\'arrêt lors du drame mais ne présentait aucun signe d\'effraction. Vraisemblablement le tueur n\'était pas caché dans le véhicule car l\'enfant fut retrouvée cachée sous la banquette arrière, inconsciente et fut prise en charge immédiatement. Elle n\'a malheureusement pas été en mesure de nous apporter des informations, bien qu\'il soit évident qu\'elle ait assisté à la scène le choc psychologique a provoqué une perte des souvenirs de la journée. L\'enquête de la scène du crime n\'a pas apporté davantage d\'informations supplémentaires et il nous a été impossible de déterminer pourquoi le véhicule se trouvait si loin du trajet entre le cinéma et le domicile.\n> \n> ======================================\n\nAu fil des mois l\'enquête ne fit aucun progrès malgré les efforts conséquents déployés par les forces de l\'ordre. Aucun témoin, aucune trace du passage de la voiture sur les caméras de surveillance, et les anciens condamnés pouvant vouloir se venger ayant tous un alibi. Quant à Anastasia elle n\'aura jamais retrouvé ses souvenirs de la terrible journée et bien qu\'elle ait indiqué que son père semblait agité et anxieux au cours des derniers jours aucune piste n\'en ressortit, malgré des fouilles extensives du domicile familial.\n\nLa jeune fille étant désormais orpheline, la police contacta le membre de sa famille le plus proche, le frère de son père, Dan Sanders, qui accepta de s\'occuper d’elle. Celui-ci\n\nvivait de ses revenus modestes, travaillant dans un petit magasin d\'électronique et bien que lui et son frère se soient peu vus au cours des dernières années ils avaient toujours été\n\nEn bon termes. C\'est ainsi qu\'une nouvelle étape de la vie d\'Anastasia démarra dans le quartier de St Claude.\n\nProfondément affectée par la perte de ses parents elle se réfugie dans un mutisme et un isolement qui laissèrent Dan décontenancé et incapable de se lier à la fillette. Célibataire endurci, gros fumeur et sans la moindre idée de comment s\'occuper d\'un enfant, il finit par abandonner ses tentatives et retourna à sa routine habituelle, laissant la gamine à ses propres occupations et se concentrant sur sa deuxième identité, le pirate informatique connu sous le pseudonyme de Merlin.\n\nUn soir d\'octobre 1994 Dan se rend finalement compte d\'un changement dans le comportement D\'Anastasia, celle-ci l\'observe et semble intriguée par ses activités sur l\'ordinateur. Voyant là une chance de tisser des liens avec sa nièce il l\'encourager, avec succès, à découvrir les joies de l\'informatique et se montre un professeur patient et efficace.\n\nEn parallèle Anastasia reprend l\'école mais, toujours bouleversée par l\'événement, éprouve des difficultés à se concentrer et se distance de ses amies. La situation ne s\'améliore que\n\nlégèrement au cours de l\'année mais alors que vient le moment de la réinscription Dan a la mauvaise surprise d\'apprendre qu\'il lui est impossible d\'utiliser les fonds de son frère pour payer la scolarité de sa nièce. Ne pouvant s\'acquitter par lui-même des frais exorbitants de McGehee il se décide à inscrire Billie a l\'ecole publique William Franz. Toujours plus seule, la jeune fille s’obstine dans son isolement ce qui finit par décourager les autres enfants. Parfaitement à l\'aise dans sa solitude, ce n\'est que derriere un ecran qu\'Anastasia se sent vivre, découvrant les prémices du web. Copiant innocemment son oncle, elle se développe une nouvelle identité qu\'elle nomme Billie.\n\nDès septembre 1996 Anastasia entre au collège Bishop Perry, toujours solitaire et se concentrant sur les cours elle vit une existence banale jusqu\'au jour où Winston Reese fait irruption dans sa vie, décidant de s\'intéresser à cette jeune fille discrète, et a force de persévérance devient finalement son ami. Il découvre et accepte la passion de Billy pour l\'informatique, et l\'encourage à traîner avec lui dans le quartier. Le temps passe Et Billie s\'intègre progressivement dans le cercle d\'amis de Winston, faisant les 400 coups avec eux lorsqu\'elle n\'est pas scotchée sur son clavier.\n\nLes années passent et Billie développe un intérêt grandissant pour les informations douteuses et underground sur lesquelles elle tombe dans les recoins les plus sombres du net, les différentes informations sur les nombreux complots pullulant sur le dark web deviennent une obsession pour elle mais la difficulté à les obtenir la pousse à approfondir ses talents informatiques, et notamment en hacking. Traînant régulièrement avec Winston, qui devient de plus en endurci, elle est initiée très jeune à l\'alcool et aux drogues douces, dans lesquels elle plonge brièvement y trouvant là une source de plaisir et de confort dans un monde qu\'elle trouve sombre et déprimant.\n\nEn 1999 elle intègre le lycée John McDonogh. Winston ayant quitté le système scolaire son influence sur Billie se fait moins forte, ce qui l\'amène à se concentrer à nouveau sur ses études qu’elle avait quelque peu délaissées. Ses notes s\'améliorent notablement et elle se retrouve rapidement en tête de classe. Malheureusement certains de ses camarades n\'apprécient pas son attitude de \"nerd\" et décident de la harceler. Insultes et dénigrement quotidiens, dégradations de ses affaires et parfois même violence physique la poussent encore plus dans ses retranchements. C\'est à ce moment que Jacob Pool l\'aborde. Charmant, social et visiblement intéressé, il fait cesser le harcèlement et l\'intègre dans son groupe d\'amis. Ils se rapprochent alors et, malgré les réticences initiales de\n\nBillie, finissent par sortir ensemble le 15 avril 2001. C\'est la semaine suivante, en revenant d\'une fête qu\'elle perd sa virginité. Complètement dominée par l\'extase de l\'acte elle ne\n\nremarque pas tout de suite le changement de comportement de Jacob, et c\'est avec un sourire narquois que celui-ci mets fin à leur relation quelque jours plus tard, ayant accompli son but.\n\nTrahie et profondement blessee, Billie, qui ne se rends plus en cours, se réfugie à nouveau dans le net et y passe ses journées sous l’alias \"La Fée Morgane\", hacker qui\n\nse fait rapidement un nom au sein du dark web. Elle finit par rencontrer Perséphone, qui l\'invite dans le chan IRC d\'Hadès, repaire d\'un groupe de 12 hackers se faisant justice eux même en traquant des réseaux illégaux de toutes sortes afin de dévoiler leurs agissements aux autorités. Au fil des années, les dossiers de Billie sur les différents complots ont prit de l\'ampleur et c\'est par chance qu\'elle tombe sur un vieil article concernant l\'événement qui a coûté la vie à ses parents. Provenant d\'un magazine peu fiable sur le surnaturel celui-ci fait référence à l\'absence de toutes traces et évoque une possession par un esprit du malin. Ébranlée et sa curiosité piquée à vif, Billie épluche toutes les informations qu\'elle peut trouver, ayant confié à Perséphone sa véritable identité celle-ci l’appuie dans ses recherches, mais même son aide et celle de Merlin ne suffiront pas à percer le mystère qui semblera s\'épaissir et c\'est avec frustration et dégoût que Billie se rend compte qu\'il lui est pour le moment impossible de percer ce secret.\n\nCherchant une source de réconfort, Billie recontacte alors Winston, qui entre temps a rejoint un gang affilié aux Bloods. Celui-ci l\'entraîne dans des boites de nuits undergrounds et des\n\nbars louches, ou elle replonge dans ses travers d\'alcool et d\'herbes. Mais cela ne suffit pas à combler ce vide qu\'elle ressent, et repensant à son aventure avec Jacob elle se met à\n\ncoucher régulièrement avec des hommes toujours differents, cherchant le plaisir et a oublier la douleur de la trahison. Plutot mignonne, malgré son apparence négligée, Billie rentre\n\nrarement seule, montrant une agressivité qui jure avec son attitude effacée et calme habituelle.\n\nEn dehors de sa vie nocturne, la jeune fille, qui a totalement abandonné ses études, sort peu, restant collée pendant des heures devant son ordinateur occupée par ses propres recherches, celles au nom d\'Hydra et les petits jobs qu\'elle accepte. Il s’agit principalement d\'enquêtes pour des détectives privés sachant les informations protégées ou inaccessibles par des moyens usuels. S\'étant attiré une solide réputation pour son sérieux, son efficacité et sa discrétion, ses clients, bien que peu nombreux, sont réguliers et payent généreusement ce qui lui permet de vivre convenablement tout en aidant son oncle.\n\nAujourd\'hui, Billie vit toujours chez son oncle Dan, et bien qu\'ils n\'aient jamais réussi à devenir réellement proche, chacun accepte et apprécie la présence de l\'autre. Son travail de hacker la passionne et l\'occupe la majorité du temps, bien qu\'elle maintienne des contacts plus ou moins réguliers avec Winston. Elle a également pris l\'habitude de sortir occasionnellement, satisfaisant ses pulsions sociales et sexuelles.\n\nGlobalement, Billie est plutôt satisfaite de sa vie actuelle, bien qu\'elle s\'inquiète de plus en plus des faits qu\'elle collecte concernant les manigances dans l\'ombre d\'acteurs qu\'elle\n\nest incapable d\'identifier, elle est en tout cas bien decidee a mettre a jour

Be thankful.” “We’re doing more with your flesh than you were. We’re changing the world and you want to change it back?” “Kill me and you suffered for no reason at all.”\n\n**Background:** She’s always been too smart for her own good — or anyone else’s. Her father said she was brilliant; her mother said she was a slut who should learn how to act like a lady. It’s no wonder she ended up sticking with dad and learning to play with the Old Boys’ Club. She attended an Ivy League college, went to med school, became a surgeon and left jealous men and her resentful mother in her wake. After that, she got bored. What other mountains were there for her to climb? That’s how she got involved in demonology. Her country club had a few white-haired coots who held secret meetings in the library basement. They didn’t let her in, so she became obsessed with getting in. It took her a few months of reading quasi-occult books and studying to earn their respect. When that wasn’t enough, she eavesdropped, got them drunk and talking and went through their things until she learned enough to intimidate them. What she discovered was that these old men were keeping a demon locked up in an area hospital — had been for 20 years — and struggled to keep it under wraps. She had a new plan. Once she had gotten inside their private club-within-the-club, she read through their books on demonology and occult medicine and devised a new way not only to imprison the demon, but to channel and diminish its power. To do it, though, they’d need kidneys — human kidneys.\n\n**Description:** She has a poise that suggests she might settle into any pose for the rest of the night. When you talk, she makes eye contact with the kind of withering confidence that says, “You just don’t get it, do you?” When you’re done talking, she exhales and looks away for a second, as if she’s thinking how to boil her thoughts down into something you could understand. Her eyes are the same brown as cigarette burns. Her eyebrows are black, pruned swooshes. She barely has any lips — they’re the pink you imagine raw flesh must be, like her mouth is just a gash cut in her face so she can talk through it. Her manicured fingers remind you that she makes surgeon money\n\n**Storytelling Hints:** Catherine has seen the insides of people. She sees them all the time. She’s probably seen inside the character she’s talking to. She knows how his kidney works, both medically and mystically, and he doesn’t. People who get mad about things they don’t understand are just holding up the works. Is it even worth explaining the truth to them?

You don’t know whether you want to fight me or fuck me. I got a body like an angel and a face like a bat. When you figure out what you want, you come tap me on the shoulder, yeah?”\n\n**Background:** The other schoolkids beat her up as a child. Said she was U G L Y ugly. Her parents—affluent, upper middle class, alarmingly normal—didn’t like the undue attention she drew to herself. They said she invited it, even though she really just tried to get through her day. By junior high, they were sending her abroad to various schools, pushing her to get a “diverse” education at the hands of several private institutions. Truth is, they just didn’t want to deal with her. They had no other kids and found her a burden: more a devil than an angel, even though she was well-behaved.\n\nCut to last year, when Mary got drunk on the night of her college graduation in the city, drunk because her parents didn’t show up, because she didn’t have any friends, because she felt as low as a worm ground into the cracks of a cement sidewalk. A few of her classmates—boys, damn near as drunk as she was—thought to have a bit of fun with her. They thought to use her, abuse her. Get her naked. Laugh a bit. If she got lippy, give her a swift punch to the gut.\n\nThey only got so far. As Mary wailed, her naked back pressed against the fire escape, something swept down. Throats opened. Blood poured out upon her. She was saved, or so she thought: then the thing came for her, too. Teeth deep. Blood gone. Then, blood right back in, a foul effluence drizzled upon her tongue that suddenly tasted sweet, too sweet.\n\nThe Requiem has been... kinder to her than to some. Certainly she feels more empowered, now. She’s chosen no covenant but has a number of friends and allies among the Carthians and will likely end up there in the next year or three. She gets herself in trouble by saying the wrong thing to the wrong people, but it’s also earned her some cred for being willing to rant and rave in the face of authority.\n\n**Description:** Every night, Mary wriggles into some skimpy tight get-up, something part leather or half lingerie. She slides on high, spike-heeled boots, or maybe a pair of blood-stained Doc Martens, or maybe she just goes barefoot. Her cleavage is good to go. She always shows a little thigh. If one were to just gaze upon her body, well, the attraction would be imminent and undeniable. But her face? Oh, poor Mary’s face. It looks like it’s been hit with a shovel. Over and over again. Snaggle teeth. Cleft lip. Eyes too big for her head. Nose crushed against her skull. She makes it worse every night by sticking new piercings and ink on her face flesh, too.\n\n**Storytelling Hints:** Mary seems to relish in the shock her appearance causes; she appears to thrive on their reaction, and she eggs it on, loving the crass dichotomy between her sex appeal and loathsome visage. Truth is, though? It’s something of a front. Mary’s never been attractive and now she’s more hideous than ever before. Those who find her disgusting hurt her, and those who find her attractive revolt her. She hides these feelings, of course; with her, it’s all bluster and boldness, all callous displays and cackling laugher. When Mary find someone who seems generally unaffected by her appearance, that person becomes something of a challenge. She ends up loving them or loathing them for their blasé disinterest. A good example? One of her local crew, Burn Barrel Matty. She can’t get a read off this lunatic, and that’s why she loves him, and that’s why she hates him.', 20, 20, '{\"1675990633\": {\"skill.brawl\": {\"info\": {\"id\": \"skill.brawl\", \"min\": 0, \"cost\": 3, \"name\": \"Brawl\", \"value\": 1}, \"type\": \"skill\"}}}', 'Contrary', '', 21, 1),

I have a lovely townhouse.”  \n “I have a nose for money, truly.”  \n “What will it take to convince you of my loyalty? Say the word, and I shall do it.”\n\n**Background:** Weldon Fontaine comes from old money. Banker money. Why was it that his sire, Blackjack Carver, targeted him for the Embrace? Carver’s never really been clear about that. Something about Carver’s own human family, and something about how the Fontaine Bank did something to them with money and foreclosure and... well, who knows? Weldon certainly doesn’t. All he knows is that one night on his way home from the movies with his fiancée, Carver attacked. Broke the soon-to-be-wife’s neck. Dragged Weldon kicking and screaming into the Embrace.\n\nFor the first year of his Requiem, Weldon found himself abused at the hands of his sire. Physically, mentally, emotionally. And it’s not like Weldon’s a tough old soul: he crumpled like a paper cup with the first kick. But Carver was relentless, a true monster.\n\nThe Invictus saved Weldon Fontaine, and to them he owes their life. While Carver was out hunting, they sent a small party to “collect” Fontaine. Certainly it had to do with their own interests: Weldon had access to money, lines of credit, investments, all manner of resources. Things that the local First Estaters wanted. And hey, they rescued him. He was glad to provide. He’s still glad to provide. They’ve found him a valuable ally, because not only does he have the connections, he is also gifted in the financial and political spheres. Weldon’s capable of smart moves and good advice, even as a neonate. In fact, him being a neonate gives him a proximity to the mortal world that other more “aged” vampires cannot manage.\n\nSo, for now, they protect him from Carver. And make no mistake: Carver wants his childe back. His abuse and anger have not yet seen a satisfying conclusion.\n\n**Description:** Weldon’s appearance doesn’t have the freakishness some expect from the Nosferatu. He’s not exactly attractive, but for the most part he looks human. Perhaps a bit gangly. Certainly too-tall. But what earns him the strange looks and shivers are two things, both intangible. The first is the aroma. Always clinging to his suits and skin is the unmistakable smell of sour milk. Stranger, though, is his voice. It’s a tremulous thing, wavering and unstable, vacillating between high pitches and low valleys.\n\n**Storytelling Hints:** Weldon’s nervous, but he tries dearly not to show it. He’s pretty good about it, really. He knows, though, that he’s swimming with sharks—and his clan association is tantamount to a gimpy fin. If they smell his weakness, they’ll bite him in half. So for the most part he stays quiet. Icy, even. Only rarely does he speak out or seem to get excited: any moment where his confidence is given the room to surge is sure to show a different, madder, more “keyed up” version of Weldon Fontaine...', 21, 21, '{\"1675991050\": {\"merit-44\": {\"info\": {\"id\": \"44\", \"min\": 0, \"cost\": 2, \"name\": \"Status\", \"value\": 1, \"details\": \"Invictus\"}, \"type\": \"merit\"}, \"attribute.resolve\": {\"info\": {\"id\": \"attribute.resolve\", \"min\": 2, \"cost\": 15, \"name\": \"Resolve\", \"value\": 3}, \"type\": \"attribute\"}}}', 'Fontaine', '', 32, 1),

But the seat’s empty, if you want to talk.”  \n “Why not play, brother? Do you have to drive yourself crazy to make the night worthwhile?”  \n “Honest opinion? Does this one make me look dead?”  \n “Of course they come to me. The trick is to keep them coming.”\n\n**Embrace:** 2008\n\n**Background:** Coveting your brother’s blessings is a sin as old as Cain and Abel. Being willing to sell your soul for it goes back nearly as far. Not many people actually get offered the choice. Annalise Delacroix did, and she hasn’t looked back. But even looking forward, she isn’t always smiling.\n\nAnnalise comes from money. Not just from moneyed people, no, from money itself. For two hundred years, her mortal family has had the best of everything: homes, clothes, schools and protectors. Those guardian angels are a cult of the Damned, breeding the Delacroix for Embrace for as long as either can remember. Without the dead and their money, Annalise wouldn’t be here. Her parents, James and Eleanor, wouldn’t have been able to afford the doctors. They wouldn’t have been able to afford the fertility treatments. They wouldn’t have been able to afford the drugs. And if Eleanor hadn’t had all that blood money and expensive treatment, Annalise wouldn’t have her twin brother, Corbin.Corbin was the success. The vampires watched the family closely. They saw potential in Annalise, but in Corbin they saw achievement. Where Annalise allocated her allowance for all tomorrow’s parties, Corbin spent lavishly on his choice of law schools. Where Annalise cultivated the dearest of friends and toys, Corbin efficiently selected the best tools to claw his way to the top of his class. Where Annalise gave herself to passion for boys and girls and rock and roll, Corbin prepared to make manifest his destiny. And so when one twin was chosen to leave the family and join the dead, it was Corbin, as the vampires had known for years.\n\nYet, Annalise’s brother didn’t leave her behind. Like Orpheus, he had to look back. He started taking her to the parties of the beautiful and the Damned. First as his sister, then as his date. And their mutual envy grew, because Corbin was immortal... but Annalise was popular. Both twins were beautiful – no need to waste time on that – but Corbin had judgment and chased trends. Annalise had style and set them. Her family’s patrons, her brother’s sire, those were Ventrue, Lords concerned with whom they stand on top of.\n\nAnnalise’s new friends were Daeva, and they were impressed with who was lying beneath her. For Annalise, the early months of her brother’s transformation were agonizing: no one to rely on during the day, the chance that she might die forever on any given night. And so she offered her friends a choice: consume her, end her agony and remember her forever as she was, or bring her into their glittering world of darkness.\n\nMaybe she was just smoking a joint after playing a coffeehouse and letting Sebastian and Danielle take nips off her cannabis-enhanced blood. Maybe she delivered her ultimatum moment of glory, with the razor to her wrist and the vampires watching in hunger and horror. Maybe it was a little of both. Either way, Danielle did the deed, and Embraced Annalise Delacroix into the Daeva.\n\nIn the months since, Annalise has been all things to all the night. To Danielle, she’s the perfect daughter and lover. To the city at large, she’s the youngest and best of the Harpies, donating her time and expertise to reinvent the Masquerades of the undead one by one. She’s changing their names, reinventing their wardrobes, updating them for the new century and the coming decade. To her clan, she’s the model of a devoted cousin and a well-adjusted Embrace. Annalise’s new extended family just adores reminding the Lords that they could have had her, if only they’d had vision.\n\nEveryone’s happy but Annalise. Where once she yearned for her brother’s immortality, now she yearns for his company. She’s moved past him, grown up faster by the grace of being three minutes ahead in the womb or eight months behind in the Embrace. He sulks and belittles her accomplishments. Yet, when they can see past their differences, when they can accept that they’re family both more or less than ever before, their bond is stronger than ever. They’re getting bad at being siblings, but they might become the very best of... friends.\n\n**Description:** Annalise’s looks favor her mother’s dusky complexion and the cut of her clothes favors her rather excellent figure. She may not look like she’s dressing to impress, but she always makes an impression. Her assortment of heavy belts, worn jeans, and gas station jackets never fail to catch eyes. At the same time, she can be taken for granted when she wants to be, sitting with her guitar in a corner and a world of her own. She keeps on the cutting edge of technology with her smartphone and her laptop, but they’re only on when she wants to be found.\n\n**Storytelling Hints:** You’re the life of the party, Annalise. Annalise isn’t dumb. She knows that she’s adored because she’s useful... and she spends hours a night making sure she stays that way. Her collection of fashion magazines, cataloged music and hipster pornography would be the envy of any marketing company looking to influence young consumers aged 18 to 32. She works on her collections and designing new Masquerades based on them. She’s developing Kindred as products, one by one, selling undead appeal to the information generation. The longer she can keep a grip on life and how to fake it, the more influential she’ll become. A few years down the road, when she starts to slip, when this month’s look starts seeming a little too much like last month’s, then it’ll be time to raise some childer of her own.\n\nHer weak spot, of course, is her brother Corbin. Her Daeva mother, Danielle, doesn’t like the boy at all, but Annalise wants to keep him out of trouble. She wants him, period. You don’t spend twenty-six years with someone and then just walk away. When Danielle and Annalise finally fall out, when it’s time for the fledgling to leave the nest and assert not only her ability but a domain of her own, Corbin is most likely to be the cause. Arrogant prick that he his, he probably won’t even notice.\n\n**Playing Annalise:** Everything about Annalise has been taken from someone else. Her jacket’s from an old boyfriend. The guitars and the art studio are from her mortal parents. Her amp is a rental she never returned. Every conversation she has is focused on how she can make sure the other party is unable to live without her, or how she can apply what she likes about them to herself.\n\n> **Annalise as Author**  \n>  Annalise could easily find employ in the service of the Collector of this book. She’s bright, good at getting secrets out of people, and her keen observational skills make her more than usually able to travel. Annalise also has her own money to spend. It’s not always easy to get to, and she’ll be skeptical of funding someone else’s cause, but she’ll trade just about anything to increase her personal status and ingratiate herself with her relatives. The danger for Annalise is that she might get just a little too wrapped up in getting the story. What might happen to her if she became more involved with one of her investigation subjects than with the shadowy old bat who set her on that track?', 22, 22, '{\"1676022354\": {\"merit-44\": {\"info\": {\"id\": \"44\", \"min\": 0, \"cost\": 0, \"name\": \"Status\", \"value\": 2, \"details\": \"Daeva\"}, \"type\": \"merit\"}}, \"1676022369\": {\"potency\": {\"info\": {\"id\": \"potency\", \"min\": 1, \"cost\": 0, \"name\": \"Blood Potency\", \"value\": 2}, \"type\": \"potency\"}}}', 'Delacroix', '', 25, 1),

Except when I’m the worst.”\n\n**Embrace:** 1984\n\n**Background:** Too tough to live, too pretty to die. Dean Rayner never planned on being Dracula’s legbreaker. He planned on breaking a few legs, yeah, but those guys deserved it. They were messing with his girl. Whatever her name was that week. Unlucky for Dean, he wasn’t so much a tough guy when the punks had knives. Or maybe one knife. Bleeding out’s a bitch.\n\nLucky for Dean, one of his friends wasn’t one of the living. That friend was what they call a Shadow, and he did what anybody would do for a dying buddy. Took him to qualified help. A doctor, in a manner of speaking, who gave Dean an operation, in a manner of speaking. New Blood for old. His girl made a donation, and he got up faster, stronger, crueler than he was before. The doctor needed to be paid, and Dean found himself shuffling around doing odd jobs for the undead.\n\nAt first, it was errand-boy stuff. Take the cooler to the Spaniard. Then it got tougher. Get the heart, put it in the cooler. Dean didn’t like it when the work got violent. Until he realized who he was really dealing with. What he really was. After that, work got a whole lot easier. Real easy to put a hole in a man’s chest when you know that he’s been killing since he was a man. Dean’s buddy helped him out a lot. Taught him how to be not just a tough guy but a pretty smart one, too. How to look for the little signs that somebody’s on your tail, or figure out where they’re running to by what they bother to pack. They’re a buddy act, sometimes, a double bill, and you don’t want to mess with either one unless you’ve taken out the other. Which nobody ever has.\n\nDean worked for the Draculas for a long time, and he’s still got friends on the team, so to speak. He’d rather be with them than with the politics fetishists or any of the god-botherers. But word’s gotten around that Dean Rayner is a man who can put things right and take a beating in the process. Word is he doesn’t even mind the beatings. They make him feel like he’s suffering, like he’s supposed to be. So lately, he’s been taking a lot of contract work. Putting down things that are less than human and lower than him. Protecting the Masquerade, humming his Requiem while he crushes some skulls. Call it therapy.\n\nAs for religion? Dean goes to church. Regular church, like regular people go to. The kind where they don’t give you shit because you bought a homeless guy a pint without getting two in return. He does what he’s supposed to, says his words to a priest, just like his mom taught him. Dean’s heard guys call the doctor his father, but that’s a misunderstanding. Some people get family when they switch sides. Dean just got responsibility. He doesn’t know where the doc is these days, anyway. He’d like to. He’d like to catch up on old times. Find out why he remembers tubes and drips and injections. Why he doesn’t remember teeth. Why he doesn’t know what happened to his girl. That’ll take a while. Old dude split town a while back, around the time Dean started getting curious, started to understand what it was like for everybody else.\n\nDean doesn’t remember the name of his girl, most nights. When he does, though, he has to drink. Drink until he forgets. Drink until he’s got bigger problems.\n\n**Description:** Dean’s a good-looking guy, even if he’d shrug off the comment. He’s got strong cheekbones, dirty blonde hair, and a chin where it’s always five’o’clock and just about time to party. His smiles are charming, but not magic; if there’s magic anywhere, it’s that all the knife scars and needle marks on his chest and arm are more appealing than worrying. His wardrobe is casual, but it’s well-picked and always ironed. It’s possible he cares more about his looks than he admits, or that he’s being taken care of by a Masquerade consultant like Annalise. She wouldn’t be the first woman to see more of him than he does. Also, about the hair? Dean’s hair always looks good. If Dean’s hair does not look good, then someone has been working on his temper. And if somebody’s been working on Dean’s temper? You don’t want to ask Dean about it.\n\n**Storytelling Hints:** Everybody gets a fair deal. Dean Rayner’ll tell you he’s ten kinds of bastard, but he got royally fucked a long while back and he’ll need to be a lot more than Damned before he does it to anybody else. If you’ve got a problem, and no one else can help, Dean might. He’s not so bad at listening, especially when he doesn’t feel like talking. But be careful about sharing your problem. Because if you’re the problem, Dean’ll be more than happy to solve you. When he’s dealing with other Kindred, Dean often lets a cigarette dangle from his mouth, unlit. It’s a threat, just a little. Shows he’s relaxed. Shows that he’ll bring fire if he feels like it. Even just to light a smoke.\n\n**Playing Dean:** Dean knows his past is just a little unusual, even for one of the undead. He asks questions — he may shun his family, but he knows how they work. He knows the players in the city, and he knows when they’re playing him. He doesn’t want to be a player, but he’ll win at the games. Accordingly, his Traits skew towards being the man to see trouble coming and the man to finish it, as Physically as need be. If Dean’s walking away from a fight, it probably means the fight’s over. He has also seen some difficult things – and done more than his fair share of them; his starting Humanity has been reduced to 5, and the resultant 10 XP used to purchase a second dot of Vigor.', 23, 23, '{\"1676023331\": {\"potency\": {\"info\": {\"id\": \"potency\", \"min\": 1, \"cost\": 0, \"name\": \"Blood Potency\", \"value\": 2}, \"type\": \"potency\"}}, \"1676023342\": {\"10\": {\"info\": {\"id\": 10, \"min\": 1, \"cost\": 10, \"name\": \"Vigor\", \"value\": 2}, \"type\": \"favoredDiscipline\"}}}', 'Rayner', '', 30, 1);

Few cities in the New World can claim so many trials and tribulations as can New Orleans, and yet through it all, Vidal has endured. He is the first and only Prince the region has ever recognized, and as a result, he has come to be seen as something of an icon among young clan members across the United States and beyond. Sadly, few realize the toll that unceasing dominion has taken on Vidal.\n\nValencian by birth and Cordoban by marriage, Augusto Vidal was a petty Spanish noble who believed that his only hope for greatness was to earn it in battle. He entered the military and aspired to attain the rank of general, hoping that he might eventually amass enough power to sway national politics. Yet his military successes, while consistently solid, came few and far between. Therefore, in an ironic twist, Vidal was ultimately forced to marry into greatness. He was betrothed to a land-owning Andalusian noblewoman whose father sought to legitimize her through marriage.\n\nWhen his bride died under mysterious circumstances, Vidal was approached by an ancestor of hers who, in a single violent night, removed him from public noble life and indoctrinated him into the private world of the Damned. In addition to being subjected to the Vinculum, Vidal owed both his holdings and his Kindred reputation to his sire (an elder of some regard), and he found himself the subject of an unending series of tests of worthiness and loyalty to both family and country.\n\nThe last and greatest of these tests came during the Seven Years War, when Vidal’s sire bade him to take a direct role in the Spanish victory over France. Although Spain did indeed win Louisiana as a result of the war, the region’s French citizens revolted in 1768 and Spanish soldiers were dispatched to restore order. Vidal’s sire asked that he go along and represent Spanish interests in the French-dominated city of New Orleans. Vidal saw his chance at freedom and accepted, knowing that it would mean an end to both the Vinculum and the infuriating tether that kept him tied to his sire. The sense of duty he’d shown his sire, however, would be replaced by a sense of duty to his clan and the Catholic faith.\n\nAt every turn during his reign, Vidal has done whatever was necessary to keep his hands firmly gripped on the reins of power in New Orleans. He was always known for his disapproval of vodoun, but this impatience has grown feverish of late. His crackdown on the rising numbers of Kindred within his domain has led many to question the Prince’s motives (and some his sanity). Many believe, and rightly so, that he is simply running out of time. Vidal must take his rest soon, and with no immediate heir apparent, many wonder what he will leave behind.\n\nVidal is tall for a Spaniard, with crisp, Mediterranean features and broad shoulders. His slick, black hair always appears wet, and he still wears the neatly trimmed Van Dyke he kept as a mortal. Unfortunately, the maintenance of this perfect facial hair takes up a considerable portion of the first hour of every night when Vidal rises, due to the fact that he was Embraced scraggly, without being given the chance to first tidy his appearance. Vidal dresses to impress, but he never forgets the lesson of function before form. He speaks with the sharp, authoritative staccato that characterizes his countrymen, and even after so many decades in the New World, has never shed his thick accent... or even cared to.\n\nIt is rumored that Prince Vidal may gain nourishment only from the blood of other Catholics. Then again, since his Blood Potency is so high he might feed only on Kindred....', 24, 24, '{\"1676025359\": {\"potency\": {\"info\": {\"id\": \"potency\", \"min\": 1, \"cost\": 216, \"name\": \"Blood

On that night, he also killed a person for the last time.\n\nOn the first night he remembers, he woke up in an abandoned basement, attended by a loyal ghoul he’d never known and still does not recognize. The poor soul was ravaged and killed, leaving behind only a tattered journal that was being kept safe for the vampire master upon his return. Bloody and torn to shreds, the remains of that journal are all that John now has as a lead to find his past and identity.\n\nFor the last two decades, John has explored what he can of his past. He gradually rediscovered his knowledge of the Spanish and Portuguese languages, and had the good fortune to find a ghoul already well-versed in Kindred society. With this ghoul’s help, John explored the new world, searching for clues as to his past existence. He learned that the Grémio’s markers around the world are still mostly intact. He doesn’t remember placing them, and yet their locations always seem familiar. He felt he was growing close to a breakthrough.\n\nAnd then, after meeting Bennett, he backed off from his search. Bennett had a much more pressing need — a need to find his sire’s murderer and put him to the sword, or at least learn why he’d been killed. Stevenson put his own quest on hold, and his mental state has benefited for it. No longer obsessive about the past, he is free to truly experience his unlife.\n\n**Description:** He is a short and dark-skinned man. Most likely from a tropical environment, he has not lost the hardiness or agility that certainly benefited him during his mortal days. Tonight, he is a simple man, preferring blue jeans, sturdy shirts and a worn pair of boots. Function rules over form, not only in his choice of clothing, but in his choice of vehicles, residence and unlifestyle as well.\n\n**Storytelling Hints:** John is likely to be the calmest and most rational vampire any Kindred will meet. There is an inner peace that none can match. “Ignorance is bliss,” some of his naysayers whisper from a distance. Certainly suspicious and extremely cautious about what may haunt him from his past, a curiosity drives him. The hidden treasures of his past don’t hold the secrets to completing a partial vampire; they hold the remainder of lessons needed to finish his journey. However, should John fall into a frenzy, a monster will truly be unleashed. Pent up rage and subconscious frustration are within him with a ferocity that assures any witness that there is certainly more to John than a simple seeker of wisdom.', 25, 25, '{\"1676074525\": {\"potency\": {\"info\": {\"id\": \"potency\", \"min\": 1, \"cost\": 40, \"name\": \"Blood Potency\", \"value\": 3}, \"type\": \"potency\"}, \"merit-138\": {\"info\": {\"id\": \"138\", \"min\": 3, \"cost\": 8, \"name\": \"Retainer\", \"value\": 4, \"details\": \"Brent\"}, \"type\": \"merit\"}, \"skill.brawl\": {\"info\": {\"id\": \"skill.brawl\", \"min\": 2, \"cost\": 9, \"name\": \"Brawl\", \"value\": 3}, \"type\": \"skill\"}, \"skill.stealth\": {\"info\": {\"id\": \"skill.stealth\", \"min\": 2, \"cost\": 9, \"name\": \"Stealth\", \"value\": 3}, \"type\": \"skill\"}, \"attribute.wits\": {\"info\": {\"id\": \"attribute.wits\", \"min\": 2, \"cost\": 35, \"name\": \"Wits\", \"value\": 4}, \"type\": \"attribute\"}, \"skill.expression\": {\"info\": {\"id\": \"skill.expression\", \"min\": 1, \"cost\": 6, \"name\": \"Expression\", \"value\": 2}, \"type\": \"skill\"}, \"attribute.stamina\": {\"info\": {\"id\": \"attribute.stamina\", \"min\": 2, \"cost\": 15, \"name\": \"Stamina\", \"value\": 3}, \"type\": \"attribute\"}, \"attribute.strength\": {\"info\": {\"id\": \"attribute.strength\", \"min\": 2, \"cost\": 15, \"name\": \"Strength\", \"value\": 3}, \"type\": \"attribute\"}, \"attribute.composure\": {\"info\": {\"id\": \"attribute.composure\", \"min\": 3, \"cost\": 45, \"name\": \"Composure\", \"value\": 5}, \"type\": \"attribute\"}, \"attribute.dexterity\": {\"info\": {\"id\": \"attribute.dexterity\", \"min\": 2, \"cost\": 15, \"name\": \"Dexterity\", \"value\": 3}, \"type\": \"attribute\"}, \"skill.investigation\": {\"info\": {\"id\": \"skill.investigation\", \"min\": 1, \"cost\": 6, \"name\": \"Investigation\", \"value\": 2}, \"type\": \"skill\"}}, \"1676074603\": {\"1\": {\"info\": {\"id\": 1, \"min\": 0, \"cost\": 5, \"name\": \"Animalism\", \"value\": 1}, \"type\": \"favoredDiscipline\"}, \"2\": {\"info\": {\"id\": 2, \"min\": 0, \"cost\": 42, \"name\": \"Auspex\", \"value\": 3}, \"type\": \"discipline\"}, \"3\": {\"info\": {\"id\": 3, \"min\": 0, \"cost\": 7, \"name\": \"Celerity\", \"value\": 1}, \"type\": \"discipline\"}, \"4\": {\"info\": {\"id\": 4, \"min\": 1, \"cost\": 10, \"name\": \"Dominate\", \"value\": 2}, \"type\": \"favoredDiscipline\"}, \"9\": {\"info\": {\"id\": 9, \"min\": 2, \"cost\": 15, \"name\": \"Resilience\", \"value\": 3}, \"type\": \"favoredDiscipline\"}, \"10\": {\"info\": {\"id\": 10, \"min\": 0, \"cost\": 70, \"name\": \"Vigor\", \"value\": 4}, \"type\": \"discipline\"}, \"20\": {\"info\": {\"id\": 20, \"min\": 0, \"cost\": 50, \"name\": \"Linagem\", \"value\": 4}, \"type\": \"favoredDiscipline\"}}}', 'Stevenson', '', 25, 1),

He was an amazing student throughout school and during his brief exposure to college. Still without a true direction before he was dragged into the nights of Kindred intrigue, Bennett showed the potential to forge a path wherever he wanted to go. Unfortunately that degree of ingenuity and brilliance attracted the ancient monster needing a gateway into the modern world.\n\nHe was Embraced by a man who thought himself to be a god. Bennett could hardly argue his sire’s divinity for the first few years of his nightly existence. In time, this creature drew tremendous loyalty from Bennett. He thought of nothing but following his sire’s instructions, learning the secrets of a world long lost to time. Bennett never quite figured out exactly why a relatively minor man such as himself would be chosen by a god to carry the knowledge and to forge new traditions from those secrets. The elder fell to diablerie before his motivations for Embracing Bennett became clear.\n\nIn the aftermath of the battle in his sire’s tomb, Bennett found a number of ancient relics. Most were simply valu- able curiosities, but one broken statue changed his unlife instantly. Within the crushed statue were two books. One was a hand-bound journal written in a language that Bennett can only assume to be an African dialect further obscured by code. The other was a modern diary half-full of scrawled entries written in broken English. The diary, written by his sire over the previous decade, described a number of years leading up to his decision to leave his childe to continue the heritage and sleep until he was called back to the Earth. His sire traveled across the Americas, looking for others of his kind, as well as for a mysterious group named the Grémio de Corajoso. According to the diary, one member of this enigmatic group of vampires was hunting him in return. His sire was convinced that this nemesis lusted after his divine right of mastery over nature. After all, Bennett’s sire posited, that was this particular vampire’s history and dark passion: Diablerie. Bennett began a search for this vampire, and finally found someone who he believes could help him — John Stevenson.\n\nWhile it did initially cross Bennett’s mind that Stevenson might be his sire’s murderer, he’s abandoned that theory. His sire’s Requiem diary never mentioned his enemy’s clan and only gave a cursory description, but even so, Stevenson looks very different now than he did then (as a result of his increased Humanity). But since Stevenson was an associate of the Grémio, he’s ideally suited to help Bennett find his sire’s killer, and is more than happy to do it.\n\n**Description:** Tall and just a little on the heavy side, Bennett is an initially imposing young man. Upon closer examination or simply extended association, his own lack of social graces infects those around him. Nobody can spend much time with him without feeling a bit awkward, consistently reminded of their own failings by the blank and lost look in his eyes. He constantly carries a faint odor of decay in his clothes, most likely from his extended periods of research in his favored rural spots.\n\n**Storytelling Hints:** As Bennett reads and rereads his sire’s diaries, he forms elaborate scenarios in his mind about how the finale must have gone. Did his sire fight back, calling up plants and insects to aid him? Did he injure his assailant? Did his soul drive the diablerist mad? But as with so many people fixated on revenge, Bennett is in for disappointment. Not only did Stevenson diablerize Bennett’s sire out of nothing more than ravenous, Beast-driven hunger that just got out of control, but he now has no memory of it. Even if confronted with incontrovertible proof, there will be no confession, no pleas for remorse, not even a disdainful snarl. Stevenson has lost that part of his mind, and Bennett, sooner or later, will have to accept that there can be no closure. Whether his mind can take this blow remains to be seen.', 26, 26, '{\"1676075633\": {\"1\": {\"info\": {\"id\": 1, \"min\": 0, \"cost\": 21, \"name\": \"Animalism\", \"value\": 2}, \"type\": \"discipline\"}, \"7\": {\"info\": {\"id\": 7, \"min\": 1, \"cost\": 10, \"name\": \"Obfuscate\", \"value\": 2}, \"type\": \"favoredDiscipline\"}, \"merit-6\": {\"info\": {\"id\": \"6\", \"min\": 0, \"cost\": 2, \"name\": \"Language\", \"value\": 1, \"details\": \"French\"}, \"type\": \"merit\"}, \"merit-141\": {\"info\": {\"id\": \"141\", \"min\": 1, \"cost\": 4, \"name\": \"Resources\", \"value\": 2}, \"type\": \"merit\"}, \"merit-6-l2du\": {\"info\": {\"id\": \"6-l2du\", \"min\": 0, \"cost\": 2, \"name\": \"Language\", \"value\": 1, \"details\": \"Spanish\"}, \"type\": \"merit\"}, \"attribute.dexterity\": {\"info\": {\"id\": \"attribute.dexterity\", \"min\": 2, \"cost\": 15, \"name\": \"Dexterity\", \"value\": 3}, \"type\": \"attribute\"}, \"attribute.intelligence\": {\"info\": {\"id\": \"attribute.intelligence\", \"min\": 3, \"cost\": 20, \"name\": \"Intelligence\", \"value\": 4}, \"type\": \"attribute\"}}, \"1676075638\": {\"potency\": {\"info\": {\"id\": \"potency\", \"min\": 1, \"cost\": 40, \"name\": \"Blood Potency\", \"value\": 3}, \"type\": \"potency\"}}, \"1676075696\": {\"21\": {\"info\": {\"id\": 21, \"min\": 0, \"cost\": 15, \"name\": \"Nburu\", \"value\": 2}, \"type\": \"favoredDiscipline\"}, \"attribute.resolve\": {\"info\": {\"id\": \"attribute.resolve\", \"min\": 2, \"cost\": 15, \"name\": \"Resolve\", \"value\": 3}, \"type\": \"attribute\"}}}', 'Bennett', 'R.', 18, 1),

In fact, up until Stevenson returned from torpor in 1998, Brent’s brother Spencer also served the vampire. Unfortunately, Spencer fell victim to the elder vampire’s hunger when he unexpectedly woke up. Just as Stevenson took a new direction that night, so did Brent. Taking a week to stalk and watch his regnant, Brent realized that the vampire was different, not the violent savage he once was. No less devoted or loyal, Brent pretended to be a stranger and forged a new relationship with Stevenson.\n\nBrent took a new road in serving and protecting his master. This “new person” that his regnant had become was so much better, more rational, and far less psychotic than he had been before the decade-long slumber overtook him. The ghoul vowed to protect his master by preventing the vampire from once again embracing the monster that seemed to still be dormant within him. Hiding evidence (including a journal written by an ancient vampire Stevenson had diablerized shortly before his slumber, as well as a few documents that shed light on his past and activities for the last half-century) and carefully building the façade of being a new servant to Stevenson, Brent has carried on with his tactic of keeping his master sane by denying him his past.\n\nFate and synchronicity certainly must exist for Kindred as they do for people, Brent has mused over the last few years. That, or there is something in Stevenson’s subconscious driving him to similar goals. Several years ago, Stevenson and Bennett met and decided to pursue their quests together. Brent found tremendous wells of inner strength and creativity during the first few nights after the two Kindred met. A few well-placed diversions and small lies in those early conversations kept Bennett from suspecting anything was amiss. Brent, however, was able to sneak a look at Bennett’s sire’s diary. That confirmed to Brent that fate truly seemed to torture vampires; he now knows beyond any doubt that Stevenson diablerized Bennett’s sire.\n\n**Description:** Made a ghoul in the late 1940s, Brent had recently returned from post-World War II Europe. He’s fairly tall at just over six feet, thin, lean and surprisingly strong for his build. Over the decades, he has aged a bit and changed his style a number of times. These days, he claims to have taken to the open roads, though it’s mostly an affectation. Old jeans, tattered leather vests, oil-stained t-shirts, and a carefully faked Southern drawl completes his current identity as a long-haul truck driver.\n\n**Storytelling Hints:** Completing this vicious triangle that will inevitably explode in rage, Brent has a singular goal. That objective is simply to ensure that his regnant does not rediscover his “old unlife.” While he tends to play the part of a faithful servant (even though he feels far more like a caretaker), each waking moment is spent carefully crafting plans and contingencies just in case Thomas remembers anything; his name, his history, or his ancient connections to some lost sect of vampires. All of this time with a vampire has taken its toll on Brent’s sanity. His mind finally broke when Stevenson rose and exsanguinated his brother. The strong bonds that continued to attract Brent to Stevenson endured and perverted any thoughts of revenge into a catatonic reaction. Anytime he sees vampires in any kind of physical conflict more serious than a simple punch, he completely loses his mind, flees, and attempts to lock himself away from the monsters. Once safely away he falls into a protective terror-induced comatose state.', 27, 27, '{\"1676076358\": {\"x8d0\": {\"info\": {\"id\": \"streetwise\", \"cost\": 3, \"name\": \"Fencing\", \"skill\": \"Streetwise\"}, \"type\": \"specialty\"}, \"skill.streetwise\": {\"info\": {\"id\": \"skill.streetwise\", \"min\": 1, \"cost\": 15, \"name\": \"Streetwise\", \"value\": 3}, \"type\": \"skill\"}, \"attribute.stamina\": {\"info\": {\"id\": \"attribute.stamina\", \"min\": 3, \"cost\": 20, \"name\": \"Stamina\", \"value\": 4}, \"type\": \"attribute\"}, \"attribute.presence\": {\"info\": {\"id\": \"attribute.presence\", \"min\": 2, \"cost\": 15, \"name\": \"Presence\", \"value\": 3}, \"type\": \"attribute\"}, \"attribute.dexterity\": {\"info\": {\"id\": \"attribute.dexterity\", \"min\": 2, \"cost\": 15, \"name\": \"Dexterity\", \"value\": 3}, \"type\": \"attribute\"}, \"attribute.intelligence\": {\"info\": {\"id\": \"attribute.intelligence\", \"min\": 1, \"cost\": 10, \"name\": \"Intelligence\", \"value\": 2}, \"type\": \"attribute\"}}}', '', '', 38, 1),

He also claims to have been a companion and ally of the former French Quarter lord, Maria Pascual, until her destruction in the late 1800s. In neither case has anyone found evidence to back his claims. He appears in no records nor in the memories of any elder Kindred — including those who knew Lady Maria well — before 1848. Even after Savoy’s first noted appearance, none of Maria’s allies recall that they had any substantial contact. Regardless, Antoine Savoy succeeded in exerting dominion over New Orleans’ French Quarter not long after Maria’s death, partially because he did indeed seem to have access to her knowledge and the backing of many of her most potent allies. He maintains that his apparent nonexistence before 1848 is simply a testament to his ability to keep his activities secret.\n\nEver since the Quarter developed into the tourist locale that it is tonight, Savoy has used his dominance over it to expand his influence. Engaged in a constant, bitter struggle with Prince Vidal, who refuses to recognize his legitimacy to grant territory and feeding rights, Savoy has actually used the cold war as a means of cementing his own authority. A native Creole (or so he appears), he plays upon the historical, racial and religious concerns of the locals. Savoy portrays himself as Catholic, but he is accepting of the precepts of vodoun. He even incorporates vodoun practices into his Catholic rites, a melding uncommon but not unheard of in New Orleans. In so doing, he increases the enmity of Prince Vidal (for “polluting” the faith) and Baron Cimitiere (who believes that Savoy uses vodoun purely as a tool to gain support among its followers).\n\nSavoy paints himself as a protector of black, Creole and vodoun culture and Kindred. Many of Savoy’s detractors — Baron Cimitiere is far from the only one — paint him as a pretender who uses these causes purely to advance his own agenda. Rumor even suggests that Savoy’s allegiance to the Lancea Sanctum is pure show, that he joined that covenant because it conveys the image he desires, rather than for legitimate beliefs. The French Quarter and other poor districts of the city, already tense due to severe overpopulation (at least in Kindred terms), have more than once verged on open war between Savoy’s supporters and enemies.\n\nSavoy is remarkably open and approachable for a Kindred lord, holding an open court to which anyone may come and speak, and also making proclamations and speeches at Elysium like a politician seeking reelection. How genuinely sincere he is is anyone’s guess, but he has gathered a sufficient number of supporters and followers to stand fast against the efforts of both Prince Vidal and Baron Cimitiere to unseat him.\n\nSavoy is a short, thin man with strong European features. His hair is dark, as is the perpetual facial hair that hovers just between a five-o’clock shadow and a true beard. He prefers casual suits or sport coats and is rarely seen without a smile on his face. When he is emotional or emphatic, the faintest trace of a French accent emerges in his voice.', 28, 28, '{\"1676153120\": {\"2\": {\"info\": {\"id\": 2, \"min\": 0, \"cost\": 70, \"name\": \"Auspex\",

This strange Kindred arrived in the city in 1799, having left Haiti during the revolt against French colonial occupation. Of his time before, he speaks little, even to his most trusted followers. No one knows if he was native to Haiti or he traveled there at some point from elsewhere. He says only that he faced Final Death in Haiti and was restored to his current incarnation through the aid of the great loa Baron Samedi. Whether he speaks metaphorically or literally is another detail of which he does not speak, but he attributes his devotion to vodoun to that event.\n\nCombining traditional vodoun rites with the powerful undead magics of his covenant, Baron Cimitiere made a powerful houngan. For many years after arriving in New Orleans, he was content to be left alone to participate in the growth of vodoun culture. It was at this time that he gained his small but devoted group of Kindred followers in the city, as well as his far more substantial mortal congregations. Slowly, he began to realize that both New Orleans’ Kindred authorities posed a threat to his people — Prince Vidal because of his intolerant religious beliefs and his growing fear of Baron Cimitiere’s power and influence; and Antoine Savoy through his manipulation of vodoun and its practitioners for purely political ends. Baron Cimitiere uses his considerable influence among the kine and his small but influential group of Kindred supporters in order to oppose both threats. On occasion, necessity has forced him to cooperate with Savoy against Vidal — as much as Baron Cimitiere despises Savoy’s misuse of vodoun, it’s better than Vidal’s overt hostility toward it — but these alliances have always been short-lived arrangements.\n\nWhen he is not reluctantly involved in politics, Baron Cimitiere dwells in one of several havens located throughout poorer, predominantly black neighborhoods — the heart of vodoun in New Orleans. He conducts frequent ceremonis for Kindred and kine alike. Most of his mortal followers believe him to be solely a powerful houngan, and they remain unaware of his undead nature. Baron Cimitiere has occasionally alluded to the existence of other groups of Kindred vodouisants beyond his followers in New Orleans (in Haiti, Central and South America, the Caribbean islands and across the United States). His followers believe that one of his objectives is to eventually unite them formally in a covenant to rival the primary five.\n\nMany people mistake Baron Cimitiere for a costumed mummer upon first meeting him. He appears to be a walking corpse, his flesh gray and sunken, his teeth and eyes yellowed, his hair falling to his shoulders in stringy clumps. He dresses in the traditional fashion of Baron Samedi himself — an old black suit, cane, top hat and sunglasses. Baron Cimitiere naturally smells of rot, but he takes great pains and uses a variety of cleansers and scents to hide that fact.

Oh. Right. That’s all right, then.”  \n “That wasn’t me. Technically, I mean.”  \n “Oops.”\n\n**Embrace:** 2004\n\n**Description:** Frances is small; she often escapes notice entirely, even when she’s not invisible. Her angular, pretty face has the marks of someone who smiles a lot. A couple of strands of gray run through wavy, shoulder-length black hair that never seems to wholly behave, even when it’s neatly combed. Green eyes, hidden beneath heavy lashes, miss very little of her surroundings. Frances dressed like an eccentric, even when she was alive: she would wear a suit with a frilly blouse and at the same time wear buttons from bands like Camera Obscura and Belle and Sebastian. Since she died, she wears a lot more black. Lucy Sulphate called her a “twee goth secretary,” which is pretty accurate, really.\n\nShe leaves no reflection at all in mirrors; she casts no shadow. Her voice is high and sweet-sounding; she speaks in perfect Received Pronunciation English, although she says little around those she doesn’t know or trust. She’s still cripplingly shy, but her natural vulnerability and sweetness has been eroded by her Requiem, to be replaced more and more with the ruthless coldness of death.\n\n**Background:** Even before “WH” asked Doe to find a complier of Mekhet lore, the occulted old vampire had his (or her) eye on Frances. A sub-editor at a London evening newspaper, Frances was single, lonely and far from home. Doe began to manipulate her life. Frances found herself vanishing from sight. Disconnected from the rest of the world, she attempted a half-hearted suicide that proved far too successful. Doe dragged her out of the grave, and bade her join the Dragons. Then Doe made her begin on her task, a simple one: find out what it is like to be Mekhet.\n\n**Storytelling Hints:** Frances’s main personal asset is her self-knowledge. When she was alive, she watched people and understood them, despite her terrible shyness. Now that she is dead, she understands monsters. She continues to learn about herself, aware of just what she is capable of doing, of becoming. Maybe it’s right for her to be a monster, she thinks, but she doesn’t have to like it.\n\nEven so, she does have fun with what she is. She makes a point of feeding on the kind of people who might have bullied or humiliated her when she was alive, and enjoys playing tricks on them (such as following a victim around for an evening and messing with her stuff) before taking their blood.\n\nFrances is an excellent contact for characters seeking to find information. She may not have the contracts, but she has the training of a journalist, and knows how to find information, and that’s half the battle.\n\nFrances’s biggest obstacle is her spiteful and clever reflection. Doe ruined her life, and her reflection is more or less dedicated to ruining her death. The reflection is careful never to put Frances in danger, and might sometimes even pretend to be her friend, all the better to make sure Frances is lonely and unhappy forever.\n\n**Playing Frances:** Frances is funny, apparently sweet-natured and breezy. Her manners aren’t perfect, but she charms the few people who bother to show an interest in her with her frankness and perception.\n\nCharacters who meet Frances should find her immensely likable, which only adds to the shock when the mask slips for a moment, and she’s suddenly colder and more ruthless than anyone the characters have met.\n\n**Frances’s Reflection**  \n **Attributes:** Power 4, Finesse 3, Resistance 2  \n **Willpower:** 6  \n **Initiative:** 6  \n **Defense:** 3  \n **Speed:** 11  \n **Corpus:** 7  \n **Morality:** 5  \n **Virtue:** Charity  \n **Vice:** Envy  \n **Numina:** Selective Manifestation, Materialize', 30, 30, '{\"1676156108\": {\"2\": {\"info\": {\"id\": 2, \"min\": 0, \"cost\": 15, \"name\": \"Auspex\", \"value\": 2}, \"type\": \"favoredDiscipline\"}, \"3\": {\"info\": {\"id\": 3, \"min\": 0, \"cost\": 5, \"name\": \"Celerity\", \"value\": 1}, \"type\": \"favoredDiscipline\"}, \"merit-42\": {\"info\": {\"id\": \"42\", \"min\": 0, \"cost\": 6, \"name\": \"Haven\", \"value\": 2, \"details\": \"Location\"}, \"type\": \"merit\"}, \"merit-44\": {\"info\": {\"id\": \"44\", \"min\": 0, \"cost\": 2, \"name\": \"Status\", \"value\": 1, \"details\": \"Ordo Dracul\"}, \"type\": \"merit\"}, \"merit-42-1osv\": {\"info\": {\"id\": \"42-1osv\", \"min\": 0, \"cost\": 2, \"name\": \"Haven\", \"value\": 1, \"details\": \"Security\"}, \"type\": \"merit\"}, \"merit-42-3clr\": {\"info\": {\"id\": \"42-3clr\", \"min\": 0, \"cost\": 2, \"name\": \"Haven\", \"value\": 1, \"details\": \"Size\"}, \"type\": \"merit\"}, \"skill.empathy\": {\"info\": {\"id\": \"skill.empathy\", \"min\": 2, \"cost\": 9, \"name\": \"Empathy\", \"value\": 3}, \"type\": \"skill\"}}}', 'Black', '', 30, 1),

I promise, it won’t hurt.”  \n “I have... a message for you. You know who from.”  \n “I’d rather not, if it’s all the same.”  \n “It’s probably better you don’t go down that way. It’s  \n not so safe.”\n\n**Embrace:** 2005\n\n**Description:** Lucrezia is a tall, slim, Italian girl with clear olive skin, dark, heavy-lashed eyes, full lips and black wavy hair cut in a pixie crop. Her swan-like neck and graceful hands captivate. Her smile entrances, even if it never reaches her eyes.\n\nHer clothes and make-up are always pristine; she dresses in a stylish, classic, understated way.\n\n**Background:** Anna Pezzaioli was a nursing student in Milan. She was a few months into her final academic year when something terrible awoke beneath the Catholic hospital where she was on work placement. The Plague Nun who had slept there for so long could have picked anyone to be her childe and agent; Anna, sent to the basement in order to find some blankets and never seen again, was simply the first person who found the vampire.\n\nThe Plague Nun decided that her childe would be called Lucrezia, and would be free, to an extent. It’s Lucrezia who brings to Elisabeta all those who would be ghouls or provender, and it’s Lucrezia who is the go-between between the Plague Nun and the Kindred courts to which she travels (and it’s Lucrezia who ultimately handles the terrifying logistics of travel).\n\n**Storytelling Hints:** Lucrezia is softly-spoken and thoughtful, but is perhaps too easily read. She hates Elisabeta with every atom of her being. She wants to be free, but Elisabeta’s blood-bound ghouls are a caution to her: the thought of losing her free will and... loving that ancient horror makes skin that’s not even able to crawl anymore prickle.\n\n**Playing Lucrezia:** Lucrezia is friendly, pleasant and apologetic. She knows she is lovely to look at, and like many lovely people, is a little vain about that. She says perhaps too much, and is still prone to move her hands while talking. When angry, she can be quite wild to watch. In play, Lucrezia is a go-between courts (and characters) and the ancient monster she serves. It’s easy to see that Lucrezia wants an out, but at the same time, she’s cautious of what others will expect of her, and of the ever-present devoted ghouls who watch her as much as do her bidding (since it is only the current order of their Mistress that they follow Lucrezia – and time might change that directive).', 31, 31, '{\"1676156591\": {\"potency\": {\"info\": {\"id\": \"potency\", \"min\": 1, \"cost\": 16, \"name\": \"Blood Potency\", \"value\": 2}, \"type\": \"potency\"}}, \"1676156607\": {\"13\": {\"info\": {\"id\": 13, \"min\": 0, \"cost\": 5, \"name\": \"Cachexy\", \"value\": 1}, \"type\": \"favoredDiscipline\"}}}', 'Pezzaioli', 'Lucrezia', 20, 1);

Il a été acquitté suite à la mort des témoins de l\'accusation, témoins qu\'il a tué lui-même de son propre aveu.  \n Il s\'agit de Paolo Escobar, un dealer local, crade (ordure). Arrêté pour le bracage à mains armées et le meurtre du tenancier Jimmy Jim, il y a un mois. Il laisse une fille orpheline de 16 ans.  \n Jenny est toujours aussi belle, grande blonde aux yeux noisettes. Mais elle est marquée par les révélations du meurtrier, perdue dans sa vocation à défendre les innocents.\n\nKate Rose, 36 ans, une amie de Jenny, est une \"voyante\" assez réputée en ville. Maghrébine aux cheveux roux et aux yeux verts. Plutôt petite (1m60) et fine, elle est assez jolie dans son style, avec un trèfle tatoué sur l\'avant bras.\n\nLe lendemain, Jenny est accusée du meurtre d\'Escobar, avec témoins. Kate et moi enquêtons pour prouver son innocence, puisqu\'elle a passé la soirée avec nous, et la nuit avec moi.  \n Escobar a été tué de sang froid au Alberto\'s, un bar mal famé.\n\nD\'après le témoin, Ron, le gardien du Lavomatic d\'en face, par une \"bonasse\" entrée vers 2h30, et dont la description correspond à Jenny.  \n Après avoir parlé au videur, celle-ci s\'est assise au bar, et a fumé sans arrêt pendant une demi heure. Un homme entre enfin (description d\'Escobar) et se dirige droit vers elle.  \n Il lui adresse quelques mots (\"Ouais, tu t\'es lâchée ce soir !\"), et elle le fume (sort une arme à feu et le tue de plusieurs balles).  \n Elle sort ensuite en courant par l\'arrière du bar.  \n Interrogé par Kate, il reconnait avoir pris des photos de la bonasse en question, qui s\'avère bien être Jenny.\n\nJohn Cooper, avocat de Jenny.\n\nJenny aurait été vue montant dans un taxi Mercury.  \n En interrogeant la centrale de la marque, le conducteur était Jovan Brozovich, n° 436, qui sera rentré dans l\'heure.  \n Celui-ci confirme avoir pris une femme ressemblant à Jenny, et l\'avoir amenée devant chez elle (l\'adresse est bonne).  \n Mais il affirme qu\'elle a \"disparu\" dans son taxi, n\'étant jamais descendue.

(1, 'Daeva', 'The Daeva are emotional, sensual and desirable. Sexual predators and sensual hedonists alike populate the ranks of these succubi-seducers.\r\n\r\nAmong Kindred historians, the Daeva are suspected of being one of the oldest clans of the Damned. Their moniker suggests a Persian mythological origin, and their abilities suggest that they could be related to the demons from which they take their name. A few ancient writings suggest that the progenitor of the line was a Kindred known as Aesma Daeva, but vampiric scholars debate whether this individual was actually undead or the writings merely draw comparisons to the Persian demon of lust and anger.\r\n\r\nThe name “Daeva” predates the commonly accepted origin point of Kindred society, generally understood to parallel the ascension of Rome. Certainly, some incarnation of the Daeva existed before then, but whether they had their own society or were merely a rabble of lust-crazed revenants is unknown. After the rise of Rome, the Daeva had become an inextricable part of Kindred society, and vampiric history shows that they were very active in the Camarilla, the first known social contract of the undead.', 'Other Kindred envy their beauty and grace, their ability to incite passion in mortals, the ease with which they glide through the masses — and that envy is almost as potent a draught to the Daeva as blood itself. These Kindred are consummate predators, and they would seem to be the perfect vampires. Alas, most are too dead inside to enjoy it.\n\nCalled Succubi by other clans, the Daeva are experts at making their prey come to them, practically offering themselves not merely as food but as playthings. No self-respecting Daeva resorts to attacking transients in alleyways. Rather, these are the Kindred who accompany a smitten young mortal back to her place, leaving her languid and sexually spent by morning (if she’s fortunate) or an exsanguinated husk (if she’s not). Seducers and sensualists, the Daeva could practically charm the unease off a Nosferatu. When the fancy strikes them, they play politics like a finely tuned instrument. Even allies and coconspirators who know they cannot trust a Succubus find themselves lulled into doing just that, caught up in the Daeva’s personal magnetism. Daeva become Harpies more than Kindred of any other clan, and they wield that power mercilessly. A stinging rebuke from a Daeva Harpy can shred a vampire’s reputation faster than a denunciation by the Prince himself.\n\nMost Succubi are overtly sensual beings, drawn by beauty and blood in equal measure, but it’s an artificial passion. Their ability to feel true attachment to other people atrophies over years of manipulating the love of mortals and the respect of their fellow Kindred, until the Daeva can no longer understand those emotions as anything other than tools to be exploited and motions to imitate. For all their apparent fervor, most Succubi are as dead spiritually as they are physically. They claim to understand desire, but all they truly know is need, and it is this deadening of emotions that causes so many jaded Daeva to become depraved in their efforts to feel again.\n\nDaeva move through the circles of society in which their lustful natures best serve them, whether among high society or low culture. Drawn to beauty and congregations of mortals, they often frequent theaters, galleries, trendy clubs, whiskey dives, drug dens, brothels and everything in between. Personal preferences aside, the Succubi are found through all strata of society. Their seductive natures allow these vampires to find willing vessels no matter where they go, and this ability has enabled them to thrive, to become arguably one of the most numerous clans. No single social class has room for them all, so newcomers and losers of political and social games often find themselves dwelling among the poor and unwashed — or at least the middle classes, which, since their blood is as red as any other, means basically the same thing to most Succubi. Few Kindred are as desperate as a Daeva trying to claw his way into his own niche. Wise Kindred know better than to take advantage of a Daeva in such a position, for fear he’ll one night achieve the position and privilege he seeks. The Succubi never forget a slight.\n\n**Nickname:** Succubi (male Daeva are sometimes called Incubi, but the clan itself is referred to by the more common female sobriquet)\n\n**Covenant:** The majority of these Kindred are found within the Invictus. They are well suited to the political game, and here they can surround themselves with lessers, becoming ever more jaded and inhuman as they grow older. Most Daeva are too self-centered to feel the religious calling of the Lancea Sanctum, but those few exceptions who are able to channel their sensual drive into matters of faith often obtain positions of prominence, making the clan seem more numerous in the Lancea Sanctum than it really is. Few Daeva bother with the Carthians. Why fight for an egalitarian society when the current system favors the Daeva? The Ordo Dracul covenant is home to a small number of devoted Daeva, and it would have more if the rigors of the covenant’s policies didn’t make being a hedonist among its ranks less than rewarding. The Circle of the Crone has few Daeva for much the same reasons as the Lancea Sanctum, and those who do join often do so more out of a debased and jaded sense of rebellion against societal mores than any real belief in the Pagans’ teachings. A surprising number of Succubi fall in among the unaligned, convinced, in their own self-perceived superiority, that they have no need for the laws and restrictions of society.\n\n**Appearance:** Daeva often Embrace out of infatuation — or at least going through the motions of passion — and they rarely choose to involve themselves with unattractive mortals. Thus, most Daeva are surpassingly beautiful. The clan is also highly in tune with trends and fashion, the better to prowl among and attract prey.\n\n**Havens:** Daeva havens vary, but they’re almost universally comforting... in a subtly alarming way that suggests an artificial appeal to whatever vessels a Kindred favors. Most are convenient to social or political centers. The specific aesthetics vary, but most are intended to impress any compatriots, allies or victims who might be invited in. Penthouses and condominiums are particularly popular. Many Daeva don’t bother to keep up appearances if they don’t think they’ll bring prey home, meaning that some havens are sloppy or cluttered with unsettling reminders of previous vessels’ presence.\n\n**Background:** With a growing number of exceptions, Daeva are Embraced from the ranks of society’s elite. Succubus sires look for some combination of charm, culture, seductiveness, desire to achieve, passion and physical beauty. Many Daeva Embrace mortals to whom they have become attached, but this attachment almost invariably proves false, a mixture of lust and simple hunger. Few relationships are as euphoric as those between a Daeva and a newly Embraced childe, and few grow cold as swiftly.\n\n**Character Creation:** Social Attributes and Skills are of primary concern, particularly those that aid in making good first impressions, in persuading and in seducing. Social Merits are equally common, representing the character’s connections to both mortal and Kindred society. Given that most Daeva feed almost exclusively through manipulation and betrayal, a high starting Humanity score is a good idea, since it’s likely to fall precipitously.\n\n**Organization:** Status among the Daeva is entirely a social issue, and many young ones resemble squabbling cliques more so than undying creatures of the night. Not even elder Daeva are strangers to petty vendettas and long-nursed grudges. While a Succubus is likely to join with one of her own in the face of an outside threat, they compete with one another as much as they do with other Kindred, if not more so. The Daeva therefore have no true formal structure. Those who are dominant in the Danse Macabre’s social and political scene are dominant among the clan as well.\n\n**Bloodlines:** Duchagne (an aristocratic but degenerate European bloodline that seems to have the ability to directly manipulate the senses and sensations of others), Toreador (a branch of the clan that has recognized its loss of passion and tries to re-create it by inspiring mortals either to creative pursuits or extreme emotions; they invariably grow bored and move on, leaving their former wards desolate), Xiao.\n\n**Concepts:** Bored socialite, club hopper, club owner, cult leader, cultured serial killer, full-time Harpy, jaded vampire who gets off on being a creature of the night (a fairly melodramatic attitude found only among the very young before the weight of the Requiem fully settles on them), Kindred politico, local covenant spokesman, patron of the arts, professional “escort”', 'Emotional, sensual and desirable.', 2, 104, NULL, NULL, 'LogoDaeva-63869c45d79c0.webp', 'Succubi/Incubi', '<p>Perhaps out of some deep longing for the true passions they lost after the Embrace, the Daeva have difficulty steeling themselves against the hedonism they allow themselves as members of the Damned.

Of course you can’t live without me.', 0),
(2, 'Gangrel', 'The Gangrel are primal, hardy and savage. They embody the myths of vampires turning into animals or otherwise changing form (wolves, bats, mist).\r\n\r\nMany Kindred believe that the Gangrel clan is an old one, but due to the Gangrel’s bestial nature, few records exist that can connect their origins to any specific time period. While the murky pre-history of the Kindred contains any number of legends about bestial vampires, not all of these tales coincide with the hallmarks of the Gangrel.\r\n\r\nGeographically, the Gangrel seem to hail from what is tonight Eastern Europe, where they came in contact with the nascent Camarilla and were reluctantly drawn into that society. As Rome’s holdings moved westward, so, too did the Camarilla and thus the Gangrel. Historians also theorize strong Gangrel roots in what is modern Scandinavia. Since those early nights of society, the Gangrel have chosen the outlying borders of domains for their own territories. As such, Gangrel are often seen as pioneers, eking out an existence where domains will later form, or as scavengers, clinging desperately to territories and refusing to yield once domains have fallen.', 'While vampires give mortals a reason to be afraid of the dark, there exist things that give even vampires reason to fear — creatures like the Gangrel, the predators among the predators, the most savage of beasts. Perhaps the only clan whose mere mention almost always elicits a chilled shud- der or a reverent nod, the Gangrel are, in many ways, the “noble savages” of the vampiric race. Upon their Embrace (and sometimes before), the Gangrel seek to sever their ties with everything pertaining to their mortal lives. Many prefer the counsel of animals and other beasts, and some eschew contact with the mortal world entirely. While many retain and even value their humanity, they do so within the bounds and context of their newfound existence, and not as an attempt to hold onto what’s been lost, for no other option is practical to a clan whose very soul is so intimately intertwined with its Beast. While others delude themselves about what the Embrace “truly means,” the Gangrel know what they’ve become, so they strive to make peace with it. On the whole, they spend more time in communion with their bestial side than other vampires do, and though such activity more than accounts for their nickname and reputation, few would disagree that the Gangrel truly benefit from their introspection.\n\nTheir special bond with the Beast seems to give many Gangrel a unique insight into the Kindred condition, and some of the wisest vampires to be found in all the world hail from this clan. Whereas other Kindred try to become scholars or philosophers, collecting endless data and positing on the theoretical, the Gangrel are its yogis and medicine men, its bodhisattvas and whirling dervishes. The unequivocal and irreplaceable benefit of first-hand experience flows through them, supplanting the theoretical with the practical, and making the Gangrel widely respected among those who recognize the primeval nature of the Kindred soul. This insight makes the clan invaluable, but also makes it dangerous, and some would just as soon silence the Gangrel as hear their frank wisdom.\n\n**Covenant:** Many Gangrel are largely unconcerned with matters of Kindred politics, but that’s not to say they don’t have their own views. Perhaps surprisingly, a significant percentage of the clan is active in the Circle of the Crone, which provides spiritually minded Gangrel with a ready-made forum for their rituals and beliefs, and a great many of the Circle’s leaders hail from the clan’s ranks. Some of the more proactive Gangrel find the Carthian mindset appealing, and a number of highly motivated Savages have taken up the cause in recent years. A few Gangrel fall in with the Lancea Sanctum and Invictus, due to the nature of each covenant’s beliefs. Those who are active in the latter group usually work for important elders or are elders themselves, while the few Gangrel of the Lancea Sanctum are among the most frightening and relentless Kindred anyone would ever (not) want to meet. Likewise, the Ordo Dracul sees few Gangrel, though some who join do so not to learn the blood magic of the covenant but to pursue mysteries of their origin without the hauteur of the Lancea Sanctum. A great many Gangrel also find their place among the independent and un- aligned Kindred, whose lack of structure and love of freedom are attractive to Savages who prefer that elders of other clans keep their politics to themselves.\n\n**Appearance:** The archetypal Savage is rarely concerned with his appearance, though most recognize the need to both blend in and put potential prey at ease. As a rule, Gangrel prefer func- tion over form, and are rarely caught clad in anything that restricts movement to any great degree. Due to their clan weak- ness, they must always be wary of just how bestial they appear to others, and some especially old (or angry) Gangrel typically learn some amount of Obfuscate to avoid potentially disastrous situations.\n\n**Havens:** One of the clan’s greatest strengths is its deft maneuverability, a good portion of which stems from its Discipline of Protean, which allows the Gangrel to take rest in any natural soil. Sleeping in the ground does, of course, have its drawbacks, and even the most feral of Savages comes to appreciate having an actual place to hang his hat after a while. A number of the more urbane (or at least urban) Gangrel therefore elect to take traditional havens, though their restless spirits and mistrust of other Kindred tends to keep them moving.\n\n**Background:** Potential Gangrel can come from nearly any former life, but few Savages would choose a mortal who did not possess a strong survival instinct. Beyond this, most are quite particular about those they sire. Gangrel loathe personal weakness and those who are soft of body or mind (especially given their weakness), particularly those with a paper-thin or disconnected sense of being. Clan members most admire those whose greatest strengths are the strengths of the self — self-awareness, self-confidence and self-reliance. While it is not unheard of for a Gangrel to Embrace someone who lacks these qualities (usually as a cruel test to see whether the Embrace will sufficiently toughen the person up), most Gangrel hold to their standards, as not doing so is often more effort than it’s worth.\n\n**Character Creation:** Gangrel are very honest with themselves about what is and is not their forte, and they seek to improve those things to which they are especially or innately suited. Many Gangrel come off seeming hyper-specialized, their players having devoted significant dots to those Attributes and Skills in which they are focused. This rule is a very general one, however, and numerous exceptions apply. Due to temperament, the aptly named Savages are rarely very strong in the Social department (though entire bloodlines of sociable Gangrel probably exist somewhere), preferring instead to hone body and reinforce the mind. An even mix of Physical and Mental Skills is always good, erring toward the Physical side.\n\n**Example:** The Gangrel Unholy is chasing Loki, who manages to elude her, but not before he drops a mystic artifact he stole from one of her other old enemies in the Ordo Dracul. The Unholy has a chance to figure out what the artifact is, her player rolling a dice pool of Intelligence + Occult (seven dice). The dice come up 10, 8, 7, 7, 6, 3 and 1. Normally, the player would roll the 10 again, but not in this case, as this dice pool involves the Unholy’s Intelligence Attribute. Furthermore, the 1 rolled cancels out one of the player’s two successes, leaving only one. The Unholy knows that this is an item of mystic significance, but she has no inkling as to what it does or what might activate it.\n\n**Organization:** The Gangrel are perhaps the least organized of the clans. They have no hierarchy per se and are largely disinterested in either clan structure or intra-clan activity for its own sake. The only nod they give to such matters comes in the form of an event called a Gather. These meetings serve a twofold purpose. First, as an opportunity for Gangrel to unite and update one another on the events of the intervening time. Second, as a forum for official intra-clan dispute resolution. Before this practice began, ferocious Savages visited their rage upon one another at will and without process, and the clan as a whole suffered. Thus began the practice of settling disputes at gatherings of the clan before a Priscus or Primogen, where any conflict (or combat, if necessary) could be moderated and monitored by the peers of both Savages. As a result of this practice, the clan has grown more cooperative over time, leading to markedly fewer  \n intra-clan kills. The majority of such disputes now stop short of Final Death.\n\n**Bloodlines:** Anavashra (mysterious ritualists who claim domains in India and Bangladesh); Anubi (Egyptian cultists who have feuded long with the Lancea Sanctum); Bruja (a rogue biker gang that slakes its thirsts at will and terrorizes Baja Mexico and Southern California); Matasuntha (a bloodline of warriors descended from an ancient warlord of the Huns); Taifa (sociable and sophisticated, these Middle Eastern Gangrel are known for their political savvy and social aptitude).\n\n**Concepts:** Archeologist, bodyguard, bumpkin, circuit rider, guru, mercenary, nomad, shaman, survivalist, urban predator, zookeeper', 'Primal, hardy and savage.', 2, 106, NULL, NULL, 'LogoGangrel-63869c4e7b4e2.webp', 'Savages', '<p>As befits their sobriquet, the Gangrel are more closely tied to their Beasts than are other Kindred.

(3, 'Mekhet', 'The Mekhet are quick, discreet and wise. Legends of vampires hiding in shadows, preying secretly on victims, and even learning secrets no one else but the keeper is supposed to know probably refer to Mekhet activities.\r\n\r\nSome of the oldest Kindred known to the vampiric world are members of Clan Mekhet, though most spend their time harrowed by the cold sleep known as torpor. While most are predisposed toward solitude, some have traveled with mortal armies and are even suspected of forming undead mercenary factions of their own. As with most other clans, nothing verifiable is known about the progenitor of the Mekhet line. Many stories depict reclusive Mekhet cult-leaders or masters of schools of stealthy soldiers, so the clan might have origins that abut the Pharaohs or philosopher-kings of the Classical or Ancient worlds.\r\n\r\nThe name Mekhet itself gives some clues as to the clan’s origin, as it is an Egyptian word for “amulet.” Some of the most venerable elders certainly bear features that might be described as Egyptian, while a few have classical Hellenic complexions, which isn’t surprising, considering Greece’s proximity to Egypt. The commerce between the Egyptians and Greeks, and later the Romans, corresponds with the legendary travels of members of this clan, as well as their formative role in the nascent Camarilla. Since that time, the Mekhet have traveled wherever shadows have fallen, wherever secrets lay hidden, and wherever Kindred call upon others to give them counsel.', 'Vampires have always been creatures of the night by design, but none more so than the dwellers in darkness who compose Clan Mekhet. Darkness is the hallmark of this lineage, and its members surround themselves with it like a corpse wears a shroud. The hallmarks of the clan are stealth and wisdom, so it is entirely fitting that they are associated with darkness — the better to hide them and the source of the knowledge they exhume.\n\nClan Mekhet comprises one of the most cosmopolitan memberships among the great families of the Kindred. Although they compose a clan born of darkness, these Shadows, as they are known, interpret that darkness in many ways. Some of the clan’s members are masters of the night, using their gifts and undead powers to make a place for themselves within the aristocracy of the Damned. Others are literal skulkers in the shadows, ready to plant a stake in a rival’s heart or steal the wealth from a rival’s haven. Still others are poets or painters, heirs to darkness of a more personal nature. Yet more Mekhet are diviners of secrets, questing after information itself forgotten and thus relegated to the darkness of memory. Clan Mekhet runs the gamut from filth-streaked murderers to enlightened philosopher-Princes and everything in between.\n\nWhile the clan certainly has coarse members, the Mekhet are, by and large, marked by a certain degree of finesse with whatever aspect of tenebrous unlife they choose to pursue. A Mekhet bodyguard, for example, is unlikely to be a brawling brute, but more likely to know an ornate fighting style. A Mekhet infiltrator is gracious or invisible, not a sloppy vandal. A sage or scholar might have such supernatural acumen that his abilities are downright oracular instead of merely archival. Mekhet Kindred very much consider themselves paragons of the vampiric state, so whatever they do, they devote themselves to it and refine their capacity almost to the point of second nature.\n\n**Covenant:** A great many Mekhet fall in with the Carthians or the Lancea Sanctum, both of which have strong traditions of politics and secrecy to which the Shadows can lend their talents. The same can be said of the Circle of the Crone, which typically draws Mekhet by virtue of its underlying message of redemption and meaning in the unlives of the Damned. Less philosophical and more viscerally impassioned Shadows are often drawn to the ranks of the unaligned, whose ideology of freedom (or anonymity...) is an easy fit for the wild at heart. This is not to say that the clan is weak within the Invictus, though. Invictus Shadows are simply quieter about their covenant affiliation than their boastful brothers, or are at least more reserved about the reasons for their affiliation, which typically coincide with those of the Carthians or Lancea Sanctum. More than a few Mekhet find themselves among the Ordo Dracul, as the study of its esoteric principles often coincides with artifact-finding expeditions or secrets to be gleaned from other Dragons.\n\n**Appearance:** Of all the clans, the Mekhet are perhaps the least uniform in the way they appear to others. Some play the clan archetype to the hilt, dressing in black clothing and adopting styles that allow them to blend into the scenery. Others choose from popular mortal styles and fashions, attempting to blend in with the crowd by evading individual notice. This practice is particularly common among Mekhet who associate with one particular subculture, thereby becoming an iconic, though rarely outstanding, example of that group’s tastes.\n\n**Havens:** Of all the clans, the Mekhet are typically the most polarized by their preferences and proximity to the mortal world. Some Mekhet prefer to keep close to where the action is. In large cities, where their numbers are strong, many take flats in the downtown core, or at least within short distance of various urban hot spots or the Rack. Older or more withdrawn Shadows are often preoccupied with security, and many elect to dwell in large homes on the outskirts of populated areas. Such Kindred often keep dogs and other servitors, made strong by the cursed Vitae of their masters. A few paranoid Shadows even take havens underground, where they cohabitate (or compete) with Nosferatu for shelter from the sun.\n\n**Background:** Prospective Mekhet can come from just about any walk of mortal life. The only common thread linking potential candidates is an affinity for the night itself or some metaphorical darkness, such as a pained soul or a thirst for knowledge. Many Mekhet are tutored heavily by their sires post-Embrace, in order that they understand the nature of the clan and its duties. A Mekhet sire who leaves a new childe to the misinformation of other Kindred is a rarity indeed. Some prefer to let their progeny discover the Kindred world on their own, but not even these sires stray so far that they can’t watch a protégés’ progress.\n\n**Character Creation:** Most Shadows prize those traits that best assist them in furthering their passion or their cause. Violent or politically motivated Mekhet typically favor Physical and Social Attributes and Skills, to improve their dealings with others and to allow them to strike from their namesake. Scholarly or philosophical clan members tend to acquire as many dots worth of Mental traits as they can. For many Shadow players, the process of assigning new traits is like being a kid in a candy store — just about everything looks good, but you don’t have a whole lot to spend. The best solution is to keep your character’s personality in mind when deciding what to take.\n\n**Organization:** While Mekhet is not the most tightly organized of clans, it does have some structure. The majority of it falls in line with the clan’s various bloodlines, which are generally more independent than those of other clans. Nonetheless, some clanwide structure does exist. In addition to the Primogen in any Mekhet-heavy city, the Shadows often give more deference to a Priscus in clan affairs than do members of other clans, particularly if a Priscus has earned a reputation for wisdom.\n\n**Bloodlines:** Agonistes (Mediterranean historians and philoso- phers who seek to record and retain the knowledge Kindred lose over time and in torpor); Mnemosyne (fervent vampires who pos- sess the ability to share memories and experiences through blood ties); the Morbus lineage of European origin that suffers the Requiem with tainted Vitae; Norvegi (an inbred, degenerate cult of spies and thieves); Sangiovanni (Venetian necromancers who maintain a tight family structure that Embraces exclusively from its own mortal stock).\n\n**Concepts:** Antiquities scholar, assassin, Casanova, diplomat, enforcer, fence, ghetto Harpy, pilgrim, policeman, power behind the praxis, seer', 'Quick, discreet and wise.', 2, 108, NULL, NULL, 'LogoMekhet-63869c5808610.webp', 'Shadows', '<p>As creatures of darkness even more sensitive to light than most of the Damned, the Mekhet suffer certain banes of vampiric existence more acutely than do their fellow Kindred.

(4, 'Nosferatu', 'The Nosferatu are stealthy, strong and terrifying. Their very presence unnerves people, whether by physical ugliness, foul stench or nebulous personal malignance.\r\n\r\nStudies of Nosferatu legend suggest that the clan is relatively young, possibly originating not too long before the rise of Rome, and possibly among the peoples it conquered. Certainly, the Nosferatu were active among the clans of the Camarilla, but proof of their presence before then is spotty at best. And yet, claims occasionally surface about very old Kindred who, if not Nosferatu, are strikingly *like* the Nosferatu. Whether these vampires are indeed members of the same clan, are Kindred of some “proto-clan” that became the Nosferatu, or are entirely unrelated can only be guessed at.\r\n\r\nLegends of the *nosferatu* are historically heaviest in central Europe, particularly in Germany, northern Italy and eastern France. Early records describing what seem to be broods of Nosferatu also originate in modern Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Greece, with some indication of presence in north Africa as well. Like the Gangrel, Nosferatu tend to either seek out territories before or after most of Kindred culture bothers with them. Unlike the Gangrel, though the Nosferatu adapt relatively quickly to the presence of other vampires, relying on their monstrous nature to make a place for them in the society of the Damned.', 'Not all curses are created equal, and even the Damned have outcasts. These are the Nosferatu, the most overtly disturbing of the undead. Only sometimes able to pass as human, the Haunts are horribly warped by the Embrace, either physically or... otherwise. They dwell in shadows that other vampires would not dare. Even other undead fear the Nosferatu, for their unsettling seemings are constant reminders that those Kindred who look mortal are not. They grudgingly respect the Nosferatu as well. These blighted creatures have incredible powers of stealth, terrifying strength, and they embody the monstrous destructive force that every one of the Damned can muster if pushed too far. If they had their druthers, most other clans would prefer never to associate with the Nosferatu at all, yet the Haunts’ inarguable talents and brute force make them too dangerous to ignore. So other Kindred offer them a tense hospitality, hide their unease behind wary diplomacies and pray that the Nosferatu leave as soon as possible.\n\nMany Nosferatu conceal their loneliness and resentment behind masks of indifference. They scoff in turn at those who recoil from them, belittling pretty vampires with soirées and silly political games, all the while seething at their exclusion. This isolation has fostered strong familial bonds among the Nosferatu. To those outside their ranks, they put on a unified front, creating the impression of a single extended network. The truth, of course, is that Nosferatu squabble and compete with one another as much as members of any other clan — but when faced with an outside threat, they close ranks.\n\nThe Nosferatu’s inability to blend in with society forces them to dwell apart, often congregating in places others shun. Some find sanctuary in the sewers, using influence with mortal government and construction, as well as their own substantial strength, to expand simple maintenance tunnels and sluiceways into vast underground warrens. Others lurk in cemeteries, sharing aboveground crypts with sedentary occupants. Still others prefer abandoned homes, often giving rise to neighborhood urban legends of haunted houses, or exist in the basements or boiler rooms of modern office buildings. Tradition holds that any Nosferatu is welcome in any warren until she provides her brethren reason to expel her. The Haunts might not all get along, but they recognize their common bond — not that they have any choice, since it follows their aspect like a miasma.\n\nFeared by and therefore ostracized from society, many Nosferatu become as alien as their demeanor. Others choose the opposite path, becoming surprisingly cultured, well mannered and well spoken to compensate for their unnerving seeming. The latter are the Haunts most frequently found playing politics with other Kindred. The Nosferatu are also known as purveyors of information. Not only do their supernatural powers make them foes to be reckoned with, but many elder Nosferatu are keepers of an- cient lore, rivaling anything preserved by the Ventrue or Mekhet. Sophisticated Haunts trade knowledge the way other Kindred trade favors, and if a Nosferatu doesn’t know some- thing, he can probably scare someone who does into telling him. It is this trade in terror, more than anything else, that makes the Nosferatu too valuable — and too dangerous — to ignore. After all, one never knows what the horrid Haunts tell one’s enemies, or how many of them wait in ambush.\n\n**Covenant:** The Nosferatu are everywhere. The Invictus nervously welcomes them as enforcers, informants and soldiers. Those Nosferatu who obtain power in the First Estate tend to extremes; becoming relatively benevolent rulers, remembering what it was like to be downtrodden, or attempting to make up for the anguish they suffered by heaping it upon others. Haunts who seek to understand why God has done this to them, and those penitents who feel that they must atone for whatever sins drew the curse upon them, find solace in the ranks of the Lancea Sanctum. Haunts often find a place among the Ordo Dracul, where their disturbing bearing has little immediate effect on their achievements in the covenant (and might even aid them, as it discourages casual social calls). The Carthians appeal to those who are concerned with constructing a society in which everyone, no matter how unsettling, has a voice. Those Nosferatu who truly suffer beneath the weight of their curse often find the redemptive teachings of the Circle of the Crone far too tempting to resist. Even the unbound attract those who accept their terrifying nature and who want to tear down the system that quakes at their passing — or those who just want to get away.\n\n**Appearance:** No two Nosferatu have exactly the same air, though troubling characteristics often follow patterns within “families.” Discolored leathery skin, gaping maws, rubbery skin, misshapen heads, odors like grave earth, bulging eyes, queasy stares and personal habits, gnarled hands, ineffable feelings of dread, sagging flesh — all these and more are the hallmarks of the clan. Not every Haunt is physically deformed. Indeed, many are not, instead discomfiting those who look upon them with indescribable unease. The darkness and filth in which many Nosferatu dwell make their foul miens (and fouler odors) even worse.\n\n**Havens:** Most Nosferatu dwell in places far from mortals, such as abandoned warehouses, graveyards, basements and of course the ever-popular sewers and subway tunnels. That said, some few Nosferatu choose to flout tradition and take their havens in penthouses, fantastic manors — anyplace where they can enjoy the luxuries of wealth yet still count on substantial privacy.\n\n**Background:** Nosferatu normally choose progeny from among society’s castoffs, such as the homeless, the mentally ill and criminals. Many Nosferatu Embrace out of spite, using the curse to punish vanity, cruelty or other such “sins.” Assuming a sire wants a childe to survive — which isn’t always the case — Haunts tend to choose self-reliant individuals who might actually be able to manage their new condition. Few Nosferatu Embrace out of love or affection, though even this is not unheard of. Rare but heartbreaking are the tales of a Nosferatu determined to “gift” his love with the Requiem, only to find himself the object of his beloved’s loathing when she learns what’s been done to her.\n\n**Character Creation:** Physical and Mental Attributes are more useful to most Haunts than Social. Nosferatu frequently make use of Skills such as Stealth and Survival. It’s unwise to begin with too high a Blood Potency; until a Nosferatu has obtained some experience in the Requiem, he might be forced to rely on animal blood. Although Nosferatu aren’t social creatures, certain Social Merits such as Contacts can be useful for gaining information from inaccessible areas.\n\n**Bloodlines:** Acteius; Baddacelli; Noctuku (violent cannibals who dwell near rural areas and who prefer to feed on other Kindred); Yagnatia (a Russian family that claims unbroken lineage from both ancient nobility and witches); Burakumin (an Asian lineage that might possess necromantic powers, but information on Asian vampires is regrettably scarce even by Kindred standards).\n\n**Concepts:** Bogeyman, circus freak, crude sadist, guardian angel, leg-breaker, parvenu, petty thief, rat king, reclusive eccentric, snitch, sycophantic servant', 'Stealthy, strong and terrifying.', 2, 110, NULL, NULL, 'LogoNosferatu-63869c5dcac78.webp', 'Haunts', '<p>All Nosferatu are repulsive or at the very least uncomfortable to be around.

The clan is almost tribal, with differing &ldquo;families&rdquo; of Nosferatu often sticking together or warring against one another.

(5, 'Ventrue', 'The Ventrue are regal, commanding and aristocratic. Vampires as everything from Eastern European lords on the mountain to gentrified nobles to modern corporate raiders belong to this clan.\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, the Ventrue are understood to be the youngest of the clans, almost certainly originating in Rome itself, probably in tandem with the formation of the Camarilla. While their history is relatively short (in vampiric terms), it is also distinguished, as the Ventrue are made to rule. Although none remember the name of the first Ventrue, various vampiric histories do ascribe the origin of the clan, which was believed to once be a covenant, to a single female vampire. A darker history implies that this Kindred was not the first of the Ventrue line, but that she consumed the soul of her own sire, and in so doing founded a new bloodline that rose to the status of a proper clan.\r\n\r\nAs might be surmised, the Ventrue have historically been strongest in Europe, from which they grew into North and Central America, but their presence elsewhere in the world has been relatively minor. As a clan, their numbers are probably fewer than those of any other clan, but such things vary by domain, as one vampire community might consist of nothing but Ventrue — likely all the preeminent Kindred’s progeny.', 'The Ventrue offer a very simple boast: They win. They always win.\n\nOther Kindred often despise the Lords, but they seldom dispute the clan’s boast. All too often, a Kindred works and schemes to win some prize, only to find that a Ventrue owned it all along. The officers who lead a city’s Kindred almost always include several highly placed Ventrue. The Lords acknowledge no defeats, only setbacks. The clan shares a ruthless will to power and the power to enforce its will.\n\nTheir favored Disciplines account for some of their success. The Ventrue learn to command the thoughts of other beings almost by instinct. Their mastery of lesser animals harks back to nights of domains in which the Lord was a master of beasts as well as men. Although they do not especially cultivate the arts of combat, they often prove remarkably hard to kill. Ventrue regard their supernatural gifts, however, as merely a tool to begin the acquisition of real power — the power of money, property, corporate stock, political contacts, rank in Kindred society and large numbers of mortals, at every level of society, begging to lick their boots and fulfill their commands.\n\nThe Ventrue take the feudal nature of Kindred society very seriously. Every sire tells her childe that some people rule, and some are ruled. As Lords, they should strive to place themselves among the rulers. Most Ventrue neonates already believed this before their Embrace. Throughout the clan’s his- tory, the Ventrue have sought power in whatever forms mortals offered. Kindred historians say that in ancient Rome the clan Embraced senators and patricians. In the Middle Ages, they brought knights and churchmen into the fold. As commerce became an avenue to power, they cultivated merchant princes, bankers and magnates. When states grew more bureaucratic, the Lords Embraced high-ranking civil servants. The rise of organized crime brought mob bosses and drug kingpins into the clan. At the start of the 21st century, Ventrue elders ponder the merits of Embracing scientists, engineers and computer wizards. No matter where in society the power lies, the Ventrue vow to exploit it before other Kindred even know it exists.\n\n**Covenant:** Many Kindred see the Ventrue as almost synonymous with the Invictus. Indeed, Ventrue tend to rise to leadership positions within that covenant. Almost as many find a place in the Ordo Dracul, acquiring immediate power of a different stripe, which the Lords ultimately turn toward the same ends. They also rise to leadership among the Sanctified, however, and some Ventrue find the power they crave within the Carthians, the Circle of the Crone or even amid the ranks of the unbound. Some Ventrue neonates hardly bother to hide their intent to use a gang of unaligned Kindred as a stepping-stone to power within another covenant.\n\n**Appearance:** Ventrue often adopt a conservative, low-key appearance that expresses high status without being flashy. Young Lords sometimes favor a “preppy” look, the timeless suit-and-tie uniform of business, or (for female Lords) elegant gowns or business skirt-suits, with unobtrusive jewelry. Ventrue elders might keep the styles of long ago, at least in their own havens, and in public they still tend to look decades out of date. Even rebellious young Ventrue wear their metal-studded jackets like a uniform, asserting their dominance. A Lord surrounds himself with other trappings of wealth and status, too, from the big, fancy car in the garage to the wine cellar full of vintages he will never again have the opportunity to enjoy.\n\n**Havens:** If a Ventrue did not possess great wealth before the Embrace, she often becomes rich afterward. Ventrue select their havens to reflect their wealth and power. Many Lords dwell in mansions or actual walled estates. Few would settle for anything less than a classic townhouse or penthouse apartment (with secure curtains, of course).  \n Clan tradition holds that any Ventrue may claim sanctuary from the sun at any other Lord’s haven and not be refused, but few Lords ever invoke this right. Not only do proud Lords hate to beg another Kindred’s aid, a supplicant henceforth owes a debt of honor to the Ventrue who provided refuge. Great shame would befall any Lord who denied a clanmate or who could not provide a comfortable rest, however, so a prudent Ventrue makes sure his haven can accommodate a Kindred guest or two.\n\n**Background:** The Ventrue most often seek childer among the ranks of professionals or the cream of high society. Some Lords prefer childer from “old money” families or political dynasties, as the closest the modern world comes to feudal nobility. Other Lords prefer self-made leaders such as millionaire entrepreneurs, politicians, military officers or even crime bosses. As new professions and new forms of power arise, the Ventrue bring them into the clan. The rise of the computer industry, for instance, has prompted a wave of tech-sector childer.\n\n**Character Creation:** Ventrue favor Social Attributes and Skills — the traits needed for leadership — though they also value Mental Attributes and Skills such as Politics and Academics. The clan excels at Social Merits such as Resources, Contacts and Status. Most Lords possessed great social influence in life, and they acquire more in undeath.\n\n**Organization:** The Lords track their ties of blood and obligation through an old-boy network that extends across generations, bloodlines and continents. A respectable Ventrue knows his fellow Lords’ ancestors, their broodmates, allies, enemies and Kindred owed and owing favors (though the information might be a century out of date). Two Ventrue often compare lineages and acquaintances when they first meet. Thus do they establish their relationships and status within the clan.  \n The Ventrue also take clan offices very seriously. Ventrue Whips, Prisci and other clan leaders often try to hold monthly meetings of all clanmates, regardless of covenant. The Lords use these meetings as opportunities to brag, size up the competition, cut deals and chide clanmates who seem to show insufficient ambition. After all, the Ventrue have a reputation for steel-fisted power to uphold. One does not want other Kindred thinking that any Lord might go soft.\n\n**Bloodlines:** Much of the clan consists of lineages that claim descent from famous Ventrue of the distant past, such as the great Cassius. These “bloodlines” merely express pride in ancestry: A Cassian Ventrue, for instance, does not differ greatly from other Lords. Other prestigious lineages include the Licinii, the Beni Murrahim and the Rötgrafen.

(7, 'Toreador', 'Lovers and creators of art, descended from a legendary and proud Spanish nobleman.', 'To the unwashed, ignorant masses, the Daeva are sleek, haughty, alluring, idealized predators who’ve been gifted with eternal youth, beauty and undying style because they’re just that much better than regular mortals. The Kindred of the Toreador bloodline see themselves in much the same way, only they elevate themselves above the thrashing, hedonistic, uncultured Daeva as well. They’re too well mannered and aloof to say as much to the Daeva, but what they leave unsaid in mixed company could fill volumes.\n\nThe name “Toreador” reflects not only the bloodline’s noble history, but its members’ fascination with the fine arts that they hold dear even tonight. Its founder, Garcilaso de Castillejo, was the second son of a moderately influential Spanish nobleman and a peer and rival of the innovative torero (bullfighter) Francisco Romero, whose grandson Pedro carried on the tradition and is legendary even today. Castillejo might have even surpassed Romero in skill and innovation in the eternal escalafon of Spanish bullfighters had he not been seduced and Embraced by an influential Andalusian Daeva while he was still in his prime. He adapted quickly to his undead state and impressed his Kindred peers with his charm, wit and grace. He even continued to fight bulls in secluded, hidden arenas for the delighted Kindred nobility until King Philip V decried the sport as barbarous and pressured a compliant pope to threaten willful noble toreros with excommunication. Fickle Spanish Sanctified chose to enforce Philip’s will among their own kind, denouncing the entire spectacle as a sacrilegious mockery of Abel’s sacrifice, largely at the urging of a Daeva Bishop in Seville who was jealous of Castillejo’s growing fame.\n\nYet Castillejo disregarded this slight with his characteristic aplomb and looked for other ways to fill his time at ease. He became a patron of the arts and a nigh-obsessive student of them, arranging travel into Italy, France, Greece, Portugal and even England to track down artists or to follow exciting new movements that caught his fancy. His adventurous spirit and unshakable will attracted cultured, indolent Daeva from all over Europe to his side, and they emulated every opinion and behavior of their charismatic torero in attempts to curry his favor. In time, amused outsiders came to refer to not only Castillejo but his growing cult of personality as El Toreros. When Castillejo finally chose to Embrace childer and those progeny demonstrated an aptitude for Dominate —which iron-willed Castillejo had learned from a Ventrue patron and lover in Venice — the nickname was applied to them as well.\n\nWhen the bloodline gained recognition among European Kindred societies, it was known as the Torero line, and it remained thus for almost a century. Then, in the last quarter of the 19th century, Castillejo’s favorite childe, Cristóbal de la Vega saw the opening-night performance of Bizet’s opera Carmen. He was so profoundly moved by the performance of Jacques Bouhy as the bullfighter Escamillo that he convinced Castillejo to come see the performance with him the next night. When he did, Castillejo was so pleased by Bouhy’s performance that he insisted upon the adoption of the inexpertly translated word “Toreador” in place of Torero in reference to his bloodline. Ever eager to please their founder and paragon, vampires of the line and associated Daeva hangers-on eagerly followed suit.\n\nIn the century-and-a-quarter since then, however, Castillejo has grown jaded and bored by the evolution of what passes for fine art. He has withdrawn into seclusion somewhere in the mountains of Andalusia to pray that the inspired artists of the Age of Enlightenment will be reborn soon so he’ll have a reason to travel the world again as he did as a young Kindred. Yet his haughty sycophants can be found all over the world, insinuating themselves among the mortal elite in cultural centers of high art (such as New York, Paris, Milan and Madrid). Many of them spend their nights seeking inspired, classically trained artists and attempting to groom them into talented Kindred prodigies whose works will shake Castillejo out of his ennui. Others slavishly try to hone their own talents to perfection in hopes of doing the same thing. Some have even realized they don’t need Castillejo’s constant attention and approval to enjoy the status and influence they’ve garnered as Toreador. Possessed of their inceptor’s will, determination and grace, they’ve set their sights on supplanting the disconsolate old Kindred in the affections of their adoring brothers and sisters.\n\nCovenant: The Toreador believe any covenant would be lucky to have them, but not every covenant is worthy of them. Nonetheless, no self-respecting Toreador is so gauche as to go slumming among the unaligned. (*Honestly*....) The closest many Toreador come to thumbing their noses at established authority and going their own way is joining the Carthians, though they usually do so only to spite a rival in an opposing covenant or because the Carthians have the most sway in the Toreador’s chosen domain. Members of the bloodline traditionally shy away from joining the Circle of the Crone because of a story their elders hand down about a member of that covenant whom their founder held in particular contempt and openly derided at court. Likewise, they both fear and respect devout members of the Lancea Sanctum, though they are wary of the intentions of certain hypocritical or overzealous Sanctified. And yet, piety and passion have inspired some of the most profoundly moving works of art in history, so finding the odd Toreador among the Lancea Sanctum is not unheard of. Many Toreador can be found among the Ordo Dracul, although many members of the Order consider the Toreador effete dilettantes who don’t have the capacity to master the Coils of the Dragon (which is not generally an inaccurate estimation). The covenant that attracts most Toreador is the Invictus. Not only is the Invictus accepting of them, but it aspires to the ideal of the undying feudal elite, of which the Toreador naturally account themselves.\n\n**Appearance:** The eldest and most influential Toreador come from Spanish or Italian stock (including Sardinia and Corsica). They show the same range of appearance as south European mortals, from the duskiness of a part-Moorish Andalusian to the blonde hair of a part-Nordic Lombard. Young Patrons display a wider variety of ethnicity, but all of them represent the ideals of classical or exotic beauty to which men and women of the era in which they were Embraced aspired. In public and among their few accepted peers, they dress as paragons of the styles most popular at the time. In private, many Toreador cling to the bygone high-style fashions of their breathing days.\n\n**Haven:** Toreador havens come in two varieties: the disarrayed studio of the self-absorbed artist, or the lavishly appointed haven of the elite socialite patron. The latter is far more common, and all such spaces have at least a couple of objets d’art on display. Most Toreador consider it gauche to display their own artwork (or not to display that of their guests) when entertaining fellow Kindred.\n\n**Background:** The Toreador aren’t quite — quite — as picky about selecting physically beautiful people for the Embrace as the Daeva are. Charm, wit and grace are far more important than simplistic concerns about symmetry or bone structure. They also look for artistic talent that inspires them or at least a consummate love and learned understanding of the fine arts. The Toreador are just as prone to Embrace out of guilt or passion as the Daeva, but they don’t make a habit of welcoming those illegitimate childer into the bloodline afterward.\n\nAs for adopting other Daeva into their august ranks, it simply isn’t done. It takes at least two Toreador in good standing to propose and second a novillo (a neonate Daeva of Toreador lineage) for inclusion within the bloodline, and a Toreador elder (known as a diestro) must give his blessing in a ceremony called the alternativa. If the novillo doesn’t have a traceable pedigree of respected Toreador ancestors leading directly back to the founder, it would take a miracle for him to get a Toreador to even acknowledge him, much less support his dreams of adoption.\n\n**Character Creation:** The Toreador rely primarily on Social Attributes across the board, although few can be accused of lacking in Wits or Resolve. Intelligence and the Physical Attributes are not quite as important to them as making a powerful and lasting first impression, but few Kindred can honestly claim to have met an especially weak, stupid or clumsy Toreador. Social Skills are often primary, with a notable preference for Expression, Socialize and a haughty, unspoken style of Intimidation. Social Merits predominate, as do ones such as Status, Haven and Herd — all of which reflect the decadent opulence with which the Toreador surround themselves and the allure such trappings have for mortal victims. It also makes sense to buy a second dot of Blood Potency unless you intend to play the character as a novillo Daeva struggling for acceptance among his Toreador betters.\n\n**Organization:** Since the Toreador don’t strive as a unified front to achieve a specific goal, they don’t tend to hew to a strict hierarchy. A handful might gather in an informal group called a salon, a peña or simply a clique until jealousy or petty disagreements drive them apart. These groups most often form around particularly charismatic diestros, and the internal pecking order is determined by each member’s status. These groups sometimes include fascinating or promising novillo Daeva, but only in the minority. The fickle, flighty nature of the Toreador doesn’t lend itself to long-term compatriot loyalty, so the thing that best holds a Toreador group together is an enemy or victim in common.\n\n**Concepts:** Bullfighter, buyer for a museum, character assassin, gallery owner, Harpy, Master of Elysium, promising young artist, reclusive retired maestro, sycophantic courtier, vicious critic', 'Patrons', 2, 246, 1, NULL, 'DaevaToreador-6386c308ee51d.webp', 'Patrons', '<p>Like the Daeva, every Toreador finds it difficult to resist his hedonistic impulses. When he opts not to indulge his Vice, a Toreador Kindred loses two Willpower points. In addition, all members of the Toreador bloodline share their inceptor&rsquo;s peculiar obsession with fine art. Whether this obsession is imposed culturally or inherited mystically is unknown, but most Toreador hardly recognize it as a weakness at all. When a Toreador is exposed to a work of art in a particular style (chosen at character creation), he becomes intensely fascinated with it and is unable to divert his attention. (General examples include sculpture, painting, music, drama, dance, jewelry and fashion. Most Toreador also focus on the work of specific artists, styles or movements that were popular among the cultural elite when they were Embraced.) The player must spend a Willpower point or succeed at a reflexive Resolve roll to break the spell, or the Toreador does nothing but focus on the object of fascination for the rest of the scene, or until said object is taken away. The character also regains control if he is attacked or otherwise physically broken from his reverie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The nature of this obsession need not necessarily be rapt appreciation. While the average Toreador is entranced by beauty, some focus all of their scornful energy on the work of a particular artist, period or movement that they despise, criticizing it vehemently and mercilessly for as long as others are willing to listen.</p>', 'You actually expected me to buy this modernismo trash that Alphonse Mucha inflicted on the world?

(8, 'Bruja', 'Bikers, gangers, and other thuggish and impulsive troublemakers', '> The bloodline known as the Filhos des Bruja (or Bruja’s Sons, or simply the Bruja) seems like something out a nightmare or drug trip from the ’60s. It’s a motorcycle gang of vampires, ghouls and a few handfuls of blood dolls — all dirty, mean-as-hell, leather-wearing monsters tearing up the American Southwest on roaring black American motorcycles when the sun goes down. It might almost be funny to those who’ve never seen the Bruja in action, but this isn’t some bullshit Sunday-afternoon club for impotent middle-aged men, or another overcommercialized Big Red Machine. These guys are locusts who hate you and who have no respect for notions of domain or the Kindred Traditions.\n\nThe gang first formed in the late ’40s around a charismatic punk bastard named Carlos Saavedra. Growing up a lazy, no-account orphan during the Depression, Saavedra kept himself amused with petty crime, animal cruelty and a burgeoning love of violence. Yet, no matter how many of his friends got roughed up or hauled down to juvenile detention for going along with his illicit whims, Carlos was never caught, arrested or even so much as charged for anything he did wrong. His uncanny luck earned him the nickname Hijo de Bruja (“witch’s boy”), which later became just Bruja. His knack for staying out of trouble couldn’t last forever, though, and shortly after he was drafted into the army to fight in the war, he was drummed right back out for drunkenness and incompetence. He was sent back home in disgrace, where he fell in with the Booze Fighters motorcycle gang.\n\nIt was some years later when Carlos caught the attention of an iconoclastic Gangrel who became obsessed with transforming Carlos “Bruja” Saavedra into a compliant but violent weapon who could threaten the established Prince in the Gangrel’s home domain. He Embraced Carlos and tried to urge him toward the Carthian cause, only to learn that his childe would have none of it. Bruja saw his cursed condition as a newfound power, and immediately went back to his gang to “gift” his six closest friends and accomplices with more of that same power. The seven of them then broke off from the Booze Fighters to form their own gang, the Filhos des Bruja. When Carlos’ sire tracked his errant progeny down and tried to correct his mistake, the entire gang jumped him and Carlos diablerized him on the spot.\n\nSince then, the gang’s been growing slowly and getting worse. Where it once comprised just seven troublemakers whose nastiest crimes included vandalism, assault and disturbing the peace, it’s now become a fairly widespread criminal organization. It makes money in drug-trafficking, prostitution, illegal arms dealing, extortion, smuggling, murder for hire and transporting illegal immigrants across the border, just to give a handful of examples. These activities draw customers and potential victims to them, but they also risk drawing Masquerade-shattering attention from local and federal authorities.\n\nWhat’s worse, Bruja himself has disappeared in the last five years, which hasn’t helped to calm the gang down one bit. Before he left, Carlos demanded at least a modicum of restraint when the gang pulled in somewhere to feed — he even advocated keeping the gang’s Blood Potencies low in order to maintain the option of feeding on animal blood to take the edge off the Hunger. Without him, though, that restraint is dust in the wind, and it’s only a matter of time before the Bruja start descending on isolated Southwestern towns like modern-day Vikings, murdering everyone in sight and razing everything to the ground. It’s possible that a more mature Carlos Saavedra saw this potential arising in the gang and rode away from it all in disgust, but it’s just as likely that one or two of his treacherous cronies took that option out of his hands.\n\nRegardless, the bloodline remains, and even the youngest, meanest, most ignorant members proudly uphold the values of greed, willfulness and sloth that Carlos espoused before he disappeared. In his name, they do what they can to make his gang a symbol of fearsome power and hell-bound eternal freedom.\n\n**Covenant:** This bloodline is really too small and too young to include members representing all the covenants. In fact, most members’ only loyalty (half-hearted and cloudy though it might be) is to the gang and to the ideals of the founder. While that technically makes the entire bloodline unaligned — or unbound, which is the term Bruja preferred — the odd member drifts away and winds up with one of the established covenants. Some members of the gang have gotten it into their heads somehow that Bruja hooked up with the Ordo Dracul and won’t come back until he’s become something else altogether. Their conviction inspires some jaded or gullible deserters to follow in his supposed footsteps. Others try to hook up with the Circle of the Crone, convinced that Bruja’s nickname means something, man. More rational Bruja make contacts with the Carthians when members of that covenant work hard to unseat power players and are willing to turn a blind eye to what the gang is up to in exchange for help. Sometimes said Carthians’ passion turns into revolutionary fervor, and a particularly charismatic movement-leader can lure away young, excitable Bruja. No Bruja has ever hooked up with the Invictus or the Lancea Sanctum, though, except as a result of brainwashing, blackmail or forced conversion and acceptance of the sacraments. For the most part, the Bruja try to stay the hell away from those two covenants, lest powerful elders of either (or both) crack down on the gang’s whole operation. Not even Bruja himself pushed his infamous luck that much.\n\n**Appearance:** Most Bruja are black, white, Hispanic or of mixed heritage, anywhere on the spectrum among those three. They’re generally big, loud, hairy, tattooed, unkempt, bristling with body piercings and covered in road dirt (if not blood from a sloppy feeding). The way they dress comes across as an homage to every outlaw biker movie that’s ever been made since the ’50s. They wear heavy leather or denim jackets, hobnail boots, metal helmets (if any), torn-up jeans and T-shirts, with “accessories” like aviator goggles, studded fingerless leather gloves, chain epaulets and bandanas to ward off flying dust. None of them wears any insignia to indicate what gang they belong to, but the bloodline is still small enough that most Kindred members recognize each other on sight. No self-respecting Bruja would ride anything but a burly, growling American bike — no rice rockets — or keep it in anything less than prime running condition. They might be rabble and scum, but they still have standards.\n\n**Haven:** The Bruja own and/or subsidize several out-of-the-way roadhouses and all-but-abandoned motels out there across the wastelands of the Southwest. They paid for the places with drug money or took them over as a result of too-successful protection rackets, and they’ve converted them into serviceable, sunlight-proof flophouses. These places aren’t much to look at and they have a fair market value of zero dollars, but they aren’t on any maps, and they’re within easy riding distance of (if not each other, at least) some great places to hang out, to have a drink or to get into a fight.\n\n**Background:** At its current size, the Bruja gang has adopted a fairly strict rule about not Embracing anyone else unless existing vampires drop out. It happens, though, and when it does, it usually happens to people who are already like the rest of the gang. That is to say, big, tough, hard-riding sons of bitches (or just actual bitches) who want to drink blood and kick ass for the rest of eternity. They’re not above occasionally Embracing (or at least creating Vinculums for) criminal contacts for the sake of expediency, and a handful of the really tough hangers-on were random hitchhikers, family men or police officers who got picked up and turned on some cruel whim.\n\nThe Bruja are somewhat lax about taking Gangrel they’ve never met before into the gang, since it hardly ever happens anyway. All a prospective Bruja has to do is earn the local head man’s respect (likely by surviving a surprise Bruja beatdown), prove he’s connected by blood to Bruja himself, then pony up a bike and get ready to ride out and meet the other boys and girls. Sounds easy, but if the rest of the gang doesn’t like him, the Bruja-wannabe starts back over at step beatdown.\n\n**Character Creation:** Bruja vampires don’t tend to be intellectual powerhouses, but neither are they entirely thuggish, apelike brutes. Granted, the bloodline does boast a high percentage of that ilk, but its nominal leaders are just as charismatic and commanding as they are powerful and tough (if not more so). As such, Physical and Social Attributes run a tight race with each other, with Mental ones lagging behind. Most Bruja rely on Physical Skills above all others, followed by Social and Mental as the individual sees fit. Various Social Merits help represent the breadth of the Bruja’s criminal operations and the influence and impact they have on the communities they terrorize. It also makes sense to buy at least a second dot of Blood Potency since a character’s just a punk Gangrel without it.\n\n**Organization:** The extended pack mentality of the gang is the extent to which the Bruja adhere to any form of organization. The founder’s closest companions are nominally in charge for now, but only until Bruja deigns to come back and start tearing up the road with his boys again. Said companions constantly vie for dominance among one another, and their bickering polarizes the followers around them, but the gang as a whole puts up a pretty unified front. They’re practically of one mind against outsiders who try to give a Bruja any shit, and even the occasional knockdown, drag-out between Bruja rarely results in more than somebody getting a baseball bat across the teeth or a switchblade under his collar bone.\n\n**Concepts:** Bar brawler, blood-doll pimp, coyote (in the illegal-border-crossing sense), dealer in drugged blood, dragracer, drug dealer, loan shark, motorcycle mechanic, perpetual omega wolf', 'Violent, thuggish and impulsive', 2, 235, 2, NULL, 'GangrelBruja-6387b85e3b737.webp', 'Rabble', '<p>Founded in indolence and caring little for anything other than their own well-being, the Bruja are given to the same feral urges that infect and overtake their Gangrel forebears.

(9, 'Burakumin', 'A bloodline of Japanese origin, the Burakumin consist largely of former laborers and other traditionally oppressed folk, who have found power in the distant West.', '> The Nosferatu bloodline that has come to be known as the Burakumin originated in feudal Japan within the social stratum of the same name. Beneath the samurai and the soldiers and the priests and even peasant farmers were those mortals whose professions were considered “spiritually unclean” by the tenets of the Shinto and Buddhist religions. Such professions included tanning, leather-working, butchery and the handling of dead bodies. People who made their living from these professions were declared unclean and legally worth less than other people, and grouped in small hamlets far from their spiritually poor neighbors. (Roughly translated, in fact, the word burakumin means “hamlet people.”) Considered equally impure and valueless by the Kindred Princes of the Eastern domains, Japanese Nosferatu were restricted from feeding on or Embracing from anyone outside that same class of mortal. In time, all of Japan’s Nosferatu were referred to as Burakumin, and the name and stratification spread throughout much of Eastern Asia as Burakumin Nosferatu expanded their influence under the cover of various Japanese imperialistic advances.\n\nStrictly enforced by Kindred of higher station, these mandates kept Burakumin numbers small and hemmed in what influence they could garner over mortal politics. Their low numbers and popular concentration greatly aided in the development of their uniquely grisly necromantic Discipline. As more Burakumin throughout the Eastern Courts learned it, they found that they were able to exert greater influence in their society and even to wrest occasional grudging concession from their superiors. One such concession was the right for their Prisci to petition the Princes of their domains for redress of grievances committed against individuals by younger Kindred of higher station.\n\nThe Meiji Restoration abolished official discrimination against mortal burakumin in Japan in the late 1800s, but where mortals have been slow to do away with their prejudices, vampires are stagnant. The changes in the social climate that have swept past them in the century since have not alleviated the restrictions and conditions placed on Kindred Burakumin. Instead, they have had to strike out on their own and forge their own destiny. Leaving their home domains by the handful ever since Commodore Perry “helped” open trade with the West to Japan, Burakumin have worked subtly to insinuate themselves into positions of influence over major exporters of raw materials. They also worked to gain a small but significant degree of influence over certain manufacturing concerns in the early 1900s as Japan became thoroughly industrialized.\n\nAlthough their status in the East was limited, the Burakumin’s wealth and influence in the West grew considerably. And when Japan struggled to rebuild its collapsed economy and industry after World War II, the Burakumin’s various holdings and enterprises were best suited to bouncing back and achieving relative stability. It was also the Burakumin who were most willing to leave their home domains and seek wealth and influence overseas in areas of exporting and industrial outsourcing. In the West, they’ve come to find status and respect that has long been denied them, and the support they are able to lend their compatriots back East has greatly improved their standing in the eyes of many local Princes.\n\nAnd in domains where the Burakumin’s industrial and financial influence (or meddling, depending on who you ask) is not as welcome, they can still earn respect and recognition for teaching their unique Discipline or using it to profitable effect.\n\n**Covenant:** In the Far East where it originated, this bloodline has traditionally been forced to remain unaligned. Most remnants of the Circle of the Crone covenant were wiped out long ago in favor of Shinto and Buddhist belief structures (or ones as similar to them as local Kindred could bring themselves to uphold). For much the same reason, the Lancea Sanctum has only very recently taken root there, and thus has never been of much interest to the Burakumin — though Kindred roundly disapprove of the unwholesome practice of their necromancies. The local version of the Invictus still proves resistant to accepting the Burakumin, but Western members of that covenant are considerably less so. Many Western Princes fear the strange power that the Burakumin wield, so they graciously invite Burakumin into their domains and grant them rights undreamed of back home. They do so largely to distract and placate these outsiders in an attempt to keep them docile, content and under control, but most Burakumin have been slow to realize how they are being played. The Ordo Dracul goes largely unnoticed by the Burakumin, but the ones who know about it find it baffling and more than a little oblique. The covenant that has had the most impact on Kindred of this bloodline, though, is the Carthian Movement. It proposes a state of true equality in which every vampire is entitled to an equal share in the spoils of the night, which is what the most vocal and active Burakumin have fought for since well before the Meiji Restoration. Carthian ideals have caught on like wildfire in the once-closed Eastern domains, and the Burakumin who introduced them enjoy an upwelling of underground status and influence unlike any they have ever known.\n\n**Appearance:** All Burakumin Kindred tend to exude the same disturbing, unclean, inhuman presence, which grows more obvious as their age and Blood Potency increases. As they age, they begin to reek of grave soil, and a stifling tomblike quiet emanates from them when they don’t consciously speak or make noise to counteract it. What’s more, their bodies take on a corpselike aspect that no amount of Vitae can ever banish completely. Over time, their skin withers and grows leathery until it’s no more than a parchment-thin veneer stretched taut over knobby bone. Out of dignified indifference to this condition (or sometimes out of a sense of perverse irony), most Burakumin dress and comport themselves with fastidious attention to detail. They do the best they can to make favorable impressions on Kindred around them so as to set prospective allies and business partners at ease (in the West) and to keep from giving anyone specific evidence to support unfavorable prejudices (in the East). Elder Burakumin in the East tend to favor garb that harks back to the mortal styles of the late Tokugawa Shogunate and early Meiji Era, while younger and more progressive Burakumin prefer more severe and formal Western professional attire.\n\n**Haven:** Eastern Burakumin have traditionally been restricted to communal havens in isolated hamlets populated by those mortals who are considered “unclean” by the tenets of the Shinto and Buddhist religions. Young and more urbanized ones dwell in and beneath large cities, yet well away from Kindred of higher station. Westward-looking Burakumin often wind up competing with local Nosferatu for havens, but as they grow more successful, their new homes come to rival those of the Daeva and the Ventrue.\n\n**Background:** Elder Eastern Burakumin mostly select progeny from among the societal class of the “unclean from which they themselves were once chosen. More cynical, bitter ones choose from among the beautiful, noble, powerful or traditionally pious in order to spite those who consider themselves so much more pure than the Burakumin. Bloodline members in the West have not made it a habit by and large to Embrace childer, but when they do, they choose those who can help them achieve their business and political goals and to adapt to their foreign environment.\n\n**Character Creation:** Burakumin don’t tend to have high Social Attributes, especially those who remain in Eastern domains. Neither do they place a particularly high priority on Physical Attributes. Their mental prowess has won them the niche in which they thrive, which leads them to favor Mental Attributes and Skills. Many of them tend to value Social Skills as well, although those propensities do not come as naturally to them. According to their weakness, Status is not a particularly economical buy up front, but other Social Merits (as well as certain Mental ones) can be worthwhile. It also makes sense to buy a second dot of Blood Potency since a character can’t officially join this bloodline or learn Getsumei until then.\n\n**Organization:** In their Eastern homes, Burakumin have little choice but to come together with others of their own kind, lest they face a Requiem of maddening solitude. Individual Burakumin defer to regional Prisci, who communicate with ministers responsible for passing on edicts from local Princes. Priscus is usually the highest station to which a Burakumin can hope to rise in the East, and though it conveys significant status among other Burakumin, that status isn’t worth quite as much to anyone else. Moving West, these Kindred stick together for the sake of familiarity among strangers and in strange lands, but they adhere to no established internal hierarchy. Some scatter to the four winds, never looking back, while others fall in with other kinds of Nosferatu, lacking the ability to adapt sufficiently to their new environments to forge their own destinies.\n\n**Concepts:** Ancestral avenger, aspiring upstart Primogen, blackmailer, forensic pathologist, grave robber, importer, mortician, private investigator, spectral intercessor, tanner', 'Corpse', 2, 238, 4, NULL, 'LogoBurakumin-638801599251e.webp', 'Unclean', '<p>Despite the unique power that the Discipline of Getsumei grants, and the relatively newfound wealth and influence it enjoys beyond its traditional cultural borders, the Burakumin bloodline is a decidedly unlucky one. Not only does it share the weakness of its wider parent clan (though a specific variety of it), but it also suffers social stigmas unrelated to its ghastly appearance. Like other Nosferatu, players of Burakumin cannot re-roll 10&rsquo;s for additional successes on Presence- or Manipulation-ba sed rolls, and 1&rsquo;s subtract from successes on those rolls. This weakness is due to the fact that Burakumin closely resemble the decaying corpses that they should be. Upon the Embrace, the Burakumin take on the appearance of cold, hours-dead bodies, and they cannot mimic the appearance of vital life with the expenditure of Vitae. As their Blood Potency increases, their bodies appear to wither and decay as per the natural stages of human decomposition (only matching the pace of the vampire&rsquo;s progression). This appearance of decay does not hinder the physical functions of the vampire&rsquo;s body (even though flesh might constrict and split, revealing bone beneath).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from this physical affliction, the Burakumin must deal with a social penalty as well. Try as they might to build up resources and increase their influence among mortals, line members have trouble fitting in and earning a standing comparable to that of their fellow Kindred. In their cultural homeland, they suffer the long-standing prejudices of an undying elite that cannot keep up with the pace of modern society. While they earn more respect in the West, they suffer a different sort of prejudice for being not only an offshoot of the Nosferatu, but foreigners as well. Young Kindred don&rsquo;t tend to hold such prejudices, but they don&rsquo;t tend to be the ones with all the power and influence in the domains in which the Burakumin seek to insinuate themselves. As a result of these various prejudices, purchasing the Status Merit (in all of its forms) costs double.</p>', 'Do you consider me unclean because you find my profession or my nature abhorrent?

(10, 'Malkovian', 'A Russian-descended bloodline that inflicts insightful madness on its bearers, feared and reviled by other Ventrue.', 'Most Kindred are still unaware of the so-called “Malkovian” bloodline and its peculiar, threatening gifts. The Lunatics are few — a state of affairs that those who are aware of them would like to perpetuate, by whatever means necessary.\n\nAmong worried Ventrue elders, the story of the Malkovians’ origins is now verified. It seems that a certain Dr. James Griffin Hartleigh of England’s Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum once became a bit too interested in one of his patients, an Anton Malkov. Malkov was rumored to be related to the czars of Russia, which was a chief reason, Hartleigh believed, why Malkov had been transported to Broadmoor under cover of night. (After all, the asylum hosted many such inmates whose whereabouts were a secret to all but their embarrassed and wealthy families.) Hartleigh never learned the details of the wretch’s crime, but the director had strictly enjoined him never to touch Malkov nor look him in the eye. Moreover, despite being a recluse who rarely left his dark cell, Malkov seemed to exert a strange fascination over the other madmen. Hartleigh found him an intriguing case, and their rambling interviews only fired his interest. Evidently Malkov felt the same way. Or, at least, it’s the only reason anyone can think of why he chose to Embrace the staid doctor.\n\nHartleigh stumbled home that same night and murdered his wife. Even now he cannot precisely recall what moved him to do so. True, he had always entertained certain doubts about her and the cook, but... well, never mind that. When he came to and found himself greedily sucking her blood, even such a font of Reason had to admit that something was much amiss. After hastily covering up his deed (which unfortunately required a further murder), Hartleigh stole back to the asylum to demand an explanation from Malkov. The lunatic drove him away with his mocking, echoing laughter. The doctor never dared return.\n\nAfter some months of painstaking investigation, Hartleigh tracked down a solitary old gentleman whom he had seen mentioned in Malkov’s papers. This worthy was, alas, unforthcoming. Indeed, he seemed quite piqued to learn where the errant Malkov had secreted himself, and he waxed outright wroth as Hartleigh inquired whether he and Malkov were kin and whether there was any family history of insanity or blood-diseases of which he was aware. At last the Ventrue grew exasperated with this embarrassing mistake of a grandchilde and reached into Hartleigh’s mind. But in the intimacy of psychic contact, Hartleigh reflexively reached back — and found something he could twist. With startling ease, he sent the elder Kindred into a fugue state not at all unlike the one in which he himself had behaved so regrettably.\n\nHartleigh has since Embraced several childer — doctors to “consult” and lordlings to infiltrate the Ventrue to seek the answers he himself was denied by his scandalized clanmates. In time, some of those childer have gone astray from the fold, much as Malkov did, and begotten lineages of their own.\n\nTo date, the bloodline has made no serious attempt to claim the status theoretically due it as an innovation of the Blood; its particular creation seems profoundly unwelcome. The Ventrue resent the attention the Malkovians draw to their own mental instability, and since Ventrue and Malkovians are sometimes hard to tell apart, few Lords dare discount the horrifying possibility of a hidden contamination of the entire clan. Many vampires of other broods are also inclined to go mad with time, and they certainly don’t want any “help” in doing so. For those who aren’t so inclined, their minds are the last sanctuary they have, the one thing they can still rely on after their bodies have transformed so monstrously and their instincts have fallen prey to the Beast. And so most Lunatics wisely endeavor to pass their Requiems in such a way as to avoid rousing their fellow Kindred’s ire. Of course, even the most unassuming Malkovian occasionally find himself plagued by someone who seems to deserve a taste of the curse he’s tried so hard to bear nobly.\n\nAs for Malkov, Broadmoor records claim that a fellow inmate killed him in 1889.\n\n**Nickname:** Among those rare non-Ventrue who know of them, the Malkovians are nicknamed Lunatics. When the Ventrue mention them at all (generally only to other Ventrue), they refer to them obliquely as “our most charming cousins,” or sometimes as “the escapees.”\n\n**Covenant:** A fair majority of Malkovians pretend to be something else (generally Ventrue), so they usually favor whatever covenant allegiance makes the most sense for their assumed identities. As a result, many (if not most) belong to the Invictus. The fanatical bent of the Lancea Sanctum also appeals to some Malkovians, particularly those who suffer obsessions or visions. Some petition to join the Circle of the Crone or the Ordo Dracul, hoping for the relief that mystic wisdom might bring, but they are usually marginalized sometime during the initiation process. Rare indeed is the Malkovian whose madness strikes either covenant as an aid to enlightenment rather than a sad liability. After all, the tests and trial periods that both covenants set are explicitly designed to ferret out just such inner obstacles. As Malkovians grow weary of vainly searching for acceptance in the more established circles of Kindred society, it’s likely that more and more of them will show up in the ranks of the Carthians and the unaligned.\n\n**Appearance:** Malkovians with enough self-command to recognize what they are and what afflicts them often go to some trouble to appear as anything but. Clothes might be fastidious and well coordinated — indeed, even suspiciously pristine. Among those who aspire to Ventrue status, styles appealing to elder tastes are favored. Other Lunatics are too... preoccupied with other matters to attend to such trivialities as vestment. Some can explain the etiquette of gloves and soliloquize on why stirrup pants are an abomination before God and man, but they haven’t the slightest idea what’s wrong with a morning coat that hasn’t been dry-cleaned or mended since 1932.\n\n**Haven:** Discretion is the key consideration for a Malkovian haven. After all, most Kindred require privacy, but should a Malkovian start to have a bad evening, he really needs a safe retreat where neither easily shocked mortals nor judgmental Kindred can pry. Many Lunatics adapt family homes or vacation homes to this purpose. Such places are often left to slide into a sort of genteel decay, which helps the isolation along. Others rely on the comforting anonymity of cookie-cutter apartment complexes. More outré domiciles like old fallout shelters or church attics aren’t unheard of. In any case, once settled, a haven quickly comes to enshrine its resident’s quirks, manias, idols and fears. While one area within might be scrubbed clean of incriminating detritus and kept suitable for entertaining, the greater part of any Malkovian’s home is a veritable treasure trove and museum on the subject of him.\n\n**Background:** Motivations for Malkovian Embraces vary as widely as those for any other clan or bloodline. Company in misery is a frequent one. Sometimes a Lunatic hopes that his new childe (be that childe a psychiatrist, priest, mother or simply someone who made the mistake of being kind to the vampire once) will be able to help him with his ailment, or at the very least will have the psychic strength to somehow overcome the madness and so purge the bloodline of its taint. Other sires, like their Ventrue forebears, pride themselves on selectivity, so erudite scholars and folk of “quality” are inducted.\n\nAt present, the very idea of a willing Ventrue seeking adoption into the ranks of the Malkovians is an absurdity to both bloods. Occasional rumors surface, however, of Malkovians who have made “converting” a certain Ventrue — in other words, fracturing her mind to the point where joining the Malkovians seems like a good idea, or the only idea — their pet project. So far, no such catechumens have shown up on the doorstep of Dr. Hartleigh. Much to his relief.\n\n**Character Creation:** Mental and Social Attributes are usually primary. (After all, there’s no correlation whatsoever between being mad and being dumb, though ignorant Kindred frequently make the mistake. The line hosts many an adroit manipulator and charming psychopath.) Malkovians whose Physical Attributes predominate are uncommon but not unheard of. Malkovians generally favor Mental and Social Skills as well; Academics, Science, Expression, Empathy and Investigation are particularly useful. Malkovians often possess the same Social Merits as their Ventrue cousins. Most Mental Merits are appropriate (except for Common Sense). Also, be sure to take at least a second dot of Blood Potency, to allow the character to be at all eligible for a bloodline.\n\nA Malkovian’s core derangement is key to her makeup. Mortals with mental illnesses are far more than the sum of their ailments, but a Malkovian’s curse is no mundane affliction. It runs in her very Blood. In all likelihood, it eventually consumes her soul. Accordingly, much care should be given to choosing and understanding it. Read up on mental illness; steep in literary traditions of madness, particularly the gothic tradition. Mental illness is a serious real-life issue that should be regarded respectfully, but don’t feel obliged to make your character a textbook DSM-IV diagnosis. It’s more important that derangement amplifies and enriches character, theme and story (rather than derails them).\n\n**Organization:** The relative level of cooperation among Malkovians varies. There are now Malkovians who don’t consciously realize their true heritage. In some lineages, a series of desultory or irrational Embraces has produced neonates who feel only disregard for others of their bloodline — or even outright hatred for them. In others, however, sires and grandsires still maintain a more secretive version of the age-old bonds. They gladly provide mentoring, counseling and comfort in exchange for their descendants’ compliance in their schemes. Malkovians with sires who are too distracted to cultivate them often seek out an “aunt” or “cousin” to fulfill that role instead.\n\nOccasionally, sophisticated collaborations to study and cure the bloodline’s maladies arise. Doctors, pharmacologists, psychologists, mystics and historians keeping each other informed of their discoveries through discreet correspondence. Of course, close contact among Malkovians has other hazards besides just the danger of interference from fearful Kindred. Madness can be contagious, and often it only takes one brilliant mind’s descent into unreason to drag the entire effort down.\n\n**Concepts:** Absinthe-addled roué, Arsenic and Old Lacestyle death angel, conspiracy theorist, eccentric scholar, failed suicide, health professional, idiot savant, mumbling beggar, religious visionary, scion of decaying noble line, tortured artist', 'Lunatic', 2, 241, 5, NULL, 'LogoMalkovian-638804d0d3694.webp', 'Lunatic', '<p>Malkovians suffer the Ventrue clan weakness (-2 penalty to Humanity rolls to avoid acquiring derangements after failing a degeneration roll).

Furthermore, in the case of a dramatic failure, a mild derangement is upgraded to its more severe version for the remainder of the night. (Storytellers, be sensible about this.

(11, 'Morbus', 'An ancient and infamous bloodline which can only feed on the sick and dying, a condition which they themselves may inflict with impunity.', '> For as long as the Kindred have been aware of the existence of the Morbus, bloodline historians and vampiric genealogists have been frustrated by them. Owing largely to the rarity of extensive records cataloguing Mekhet lineage over the centuries, no one can pin down exactly who the founder of this bloodline might have been or where the first niche was in which the Morbus began to thrive. The idea of constructing a truly inclusive history of the Kindred (especially as regards the Mekhet clan) from which one might solve this mystery conclusively is a pipe dream at best, but some aspire to it nonetheless. Those Morbus who choose to concern themselves with the subject consider this ongoing failure a relief and a legitimatization of their entire existence. They see themselves as simply Mekhet who are afflicted or cursed with a singular variety of rarefied tastes.\n\nThe particular preference to which the Morbus are all suspect is that they must feed on the blood of the ailing and diseased in order to sustain their vital undead state. In fact, the name Morbus comes from a Latin root meaning “diseased,” which was ascribed to afflicted Mekhet by non-afflicted ones during the reign of Justinian in the sixth century AD. According to records from that period unearthed centuries later by Kindred archaeologists, the Morbus were suspected of either spreading or helping to spread a virulent plague across the Mediterranean in one domain after another. Less solvent data has linked named Morbus from Roman records with Mekhet who were active in Greece and Egypt as far back as 430 BC, a year in which plague was said to have struck Athens. The connection this data implies is tenuous as best, and possibly wholly fabricated as propaganda against the Morbus. Nonetheless, it might have been possible for the Kindred to accept the Morbus condition as just a peculiar feeding preference if it were not for records recovered from Constantinople dating back to AD 1334. At that time, one of the most widespread plagues in history swept across Europe and Asia, aided by large numbers of soldiers and captives returning from the Crusades. The records in question describe the “righteous wrath” of a Mekhet pilgrim who traveled in secret with the Christian army. He returned to his domain once the campaign was ended to find his Kindred subjects in rebellion and his mortal herds mired hopelessly in sin. To punish them, records say, he blighted his people with a wasting sickness from within him that killed everyone for miles within a matter of days. This incident blended in with concurrent reports of blight and plague that swept the continent at the time, but Kindred historians pin it down as the first known instance of the use of the Morbus Discipline known as Cachexy.\n\nWhen captured and put to the question by Kindred Inquisitors for the act, this Kindred denied being the founder of a bloodline at all. He claimed that he had learned his unusual abilities from his sire, who had long since succumbed to the sleep of ages. When he awoke much later, the Kindred’s sire also denied developing the Discipline or founding a bloodline, but his memories of his own sire or brood brethren were too hazy to offer any more definitive leads. These records are the closest any historian has come to finding the bloodline’s true founder or tracing its evolution. Tonight, most Morbus are not as concerned with their origins as they are with survival. Once they discover their condition and the unique power that derives from it (or they have both explained to them by an older Morbus), they must decide whether to hide it or admit what they are and try to redefine their niche. Their ability to do either varies by domain, but if nothing else, periodic outbreaks of severe infectious diseases throughout history and all over the world provide sufficient vessels on which to thrive. All they have to do is keep informed and be willing to risk travel to areas in which untreated strains of infectious disease defy the cutting edge of First-World medicine.\n\n**Covenant:** Many Carriers find it difficult to make a respected name or to carve out a fruitful place among the undead of the Invictus or the Lancea Sanctum once their affliction becomes known. Kindred consider them threats to the Traditions and claim that hundred-fold damnation awaits any Morbus who breaks the Third Tradition. Princes of the Invictus simply don’t want Carriers polluting their domains and weakening the mortal pillars of their power structure with careless feeding. Some Morbus take perverse pleasure in testing the limits of Carthian egalitarian tolerance, but most would just as soon cultivate as much power and influence as they can and tell the Carthians to go to hell. Repentant or remorseful Carriers turn to members of the Circle of the Crone in hopes of finding some way to undo the curse they’ve wrought upon themselves, but no member of the bloodline or the covenant in general has yet uncovered any hope that such is possible. Others join the Ordo Dracul in an attempt to progress beyond the weakness that their blood inflicts, but no Morbus has yet achieved the true transcendence that the Order espouses. The rest of the bloodline hide out among the Kindred of the Invictus or the Lancea Sanctum — guarding the secret of their heritage for all their unlives are worth — or go it alone among the unaligned.\n\n**Appearance:** Most Morbus adopt attire based on how they intend to interact with Kindred society vis-à-vis their condition. Those who try to pass as “normal” often play to the stereotypes that they feel are expected of their clan in their chosen covenant and domain. In fact, they often overdo said stereotypes and give themselves away. Those whose nature is fairly common knowledge try to keep a low profile in “urban camouflage” (i.e., plain, baggy, off-brand clothes in neutral colors), so as to not stand out and risk being social lightning rods. Those who are outright cavalier about their bloodline — and have found acceptance in a Prince’s domain — often play to Mekhet stereotypes. They do so out of a desire to show how successful they can be despite their condition.\n\n**Haven:** Whether they’re covert or open about what they are, Morbus make just as much of an effort to make their havens a reflection of their personal purposes as other Mekhet do. The only way in which they choose havens that differs is they look for ones among or offering easy access to diseased mortal vessels.\n\n**Background:** It is a more frequent for a Mekhet to Embrace a childe who then realizes he is a Morbus than it is for a confirmed Morbus to Embrace a childe. Most Morbus childer therefore have the same backgrounds as non-afflicted Mekhet. When the Morbus do Embrace deliberately, they tend to choose doctors (whom they vainly hope can help cure them), dying vessels to whom they’ve formed obsessive attachments, or people with influence over policymakers.\n\n**Character Creation:** The priority assigned to Physical Attributes and Skills is largely a matter of personal taste, as these vampires do not necessarily need sterner constitutions to balance the diseases they carry. The choice between Mental and Social Attributes and Skills should depend on how open a character is to revealing his lineage and how he intends to adapt to his condition. It is also wise to buy up or sell off Humanity dots based on how cavalier uses of Cachexy will be, or how humane a function he considers feeding from the sick and infirm to be. Also, don’t forget to buy a second dot of Blood Potency since a character can’t officially join the bloodline before then.\n\n**Organization:** The tradition among certain elders and Kindred genealogists of tracking descent and lineage both informs and works against the Morbus. A few members trace lineage and determine intra-bloodline status based on the relative fame or notoriety of sires and grandsires. Some consider the achievements of only their confirmed Morbus forebears worthy of consideration, while others uphold any Mekhet ancestors’ accomplishments. Morbus who manage to keep their membership in this bloodline a secret, and earn status and respect from other Mekhet, earn the same again (and more) from their Morbus peers for their cleverness.\n\n**Concepts:** Angel of mercy, cult leader, demon of retribution, doctor, hospice manager, medical researcher, New-Age holistic healer, plague dog, retirement-home orderly, seemingly philanthropic political activist', 'Disease carriers', 2, 245, 3, NULL, 'MekhetMorbus-638806d7610f0.webp', 'Carriers', '<p>The Morbus are slaves to a highly rarefied palate. Only the blood of diseased and dying mortals sustains them, while healthy blood turns to ash in their mouths (though they may take Kindred Vitae and be nourished by it as normal). They can feed from other vessels only when frenzying, but doing so does not replenish their Vitae to any degree whatsoever. Some Morbus feel compelled to drink blood infected with only one specific disease, but this restriction is only a matter of taste or a psychological limitation. Should such a member be brave or desperate enough to drink from a victim with a different affliction than his preferred one, he suffers no penalty. While these diseases don&rsquo;t adversely affect the Morbus themselves (usually), they can occasionally be transmitted when the Kindred feed, share blood with their ghouls or have sex.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Morbus bloodline is a shameful aberration in the eyes of most Mekhet, which makes it all but impossible for a confirmed Morbus to gain any Status Merit or clan offices among the non-afflicted.

(12, 'Caporetti', 'Predators who stalked icy trenches during the great wars, vanishing prey as they pleased.', '> The 12 Battles of the Isonzo saw not only the horrors of the trenches, but the “white death” — avalanches brought down by the constant impact of shells against the sides of the mountains. Thousands upon thousands of men met their ends under the rolling slides of stone and snow. The lucky ones were crushed instantly. But others, trapped in their trenches, suffo- cated or slowly froze under the ice, with no hope of rescue. And some of those trapped under the collapsed mountainside faced the creatures who burrowed under the snow and dragged their victims away into the dark, one by one, storing them away in subterranean larders, keeping them alive for months or years if necessary as vessels for their thirsts.\n> \n> When the Battle of Caporetto ended, the armies withdrew from the Isonzo, and gradually the monsters of Caporetto exhausted their hellish pantries and moved on.\n> \n> Over the years, they found other burrows, other places to hide far away from that blood-soaked mountain range. But the frozen death of the Isonzo became part of that strange cold vampire tribe, and it travels with them wherever they go.\n\n**History and Culture:** None of the Caporetti know for sure who founded their bloodline. All that has been established is that the Nosferatu of the Isonzo devel- oped an aptitude for burrowing and an affinity with the cold. Of the three likely candidates for the founder of the bloodline, one had been a resident in the region of Caporetto for several hundred years, and had apparently always been that way; one was a neonate with a talent for killing; and one, allegedly, wasn’t even really a vampire. If these monsters ever existed, they were gone by the end of the Great War, leaving their childer able to make their own way.\n\nThese original Caporetti were loners who kept frozen larders made of the hapless soldiers of the Isonzo. Most of them kept to themselves, and, if they had the urge to create childer, cut them loose soon after the Embrace. The result was that beyond their supernatural affinity with the cold and the urge to burrow, the Caporetti have little in common other than the name, a certain moleish look in the eyes and a way they hold their hands... which are almost invariably large and spadelike, and usually filthy.\n\nThey traveled. They Embraced. By the end of the 1920s, Caporetti had turned up in places as far afield as the Rockies and the Himalayas. In the Second World War, coteries of Caporetti thrived in the snows of the Eastern front, and fed well on the bleeding wounded of Stalingrad, dragging them under the snow and earth as they stumbled on the killing fields of the Great Patriotic war. During the Vietnam war, a Caporetto somehow wound up in the tunnels under Saigon.\n\nMostly, however, their hunting tactics don’t define them so much as the role they take in the night society of the Kindred. Some style themselves as enforcers, or hunters, or hounds. Some keep out of the way of living humans altogether, except when they have to feed. Some set themselves up with a fake mythology as the ghosts who haunt deserted mountainsides and well-worn suicide spots.\n\n**Reputation:** Other Kindred are ambivalent about the Caporetti. On the one hand, a Caporetto is hugely valuable as an assassin — the first thing a victim knows about the presence of a Caporetto is a chill in the air, followed by the hand that erupts from the mud or the snow and drags the target underground.\n\nSome princes, on the other hand, see the presence of a monster who makes the air cold just by being there as a breach of the Masquerade that cannot be tolerated. In the end, though, it depends on the Caporetto. A vampire who attempts to make his lair under the middle of a busy park or common will attract far more attention — from vampires and humans alike — than one who keeps himself to himself and dwells up a mountain.\n\n**Concepts:** Tunnel rat, morgue worker, meat packer, sewer maintenance man, professional spelunker, missing mountaineer, escaped prison inmate, mole-man, obsessive snowboarder, urban explorer', 'Cold', 4, 19, 4, NULL, 'NosferatuCaporetti-638ab7e2a6359.webp', 'Shivers', '<p>The Caporetti have the usual Nosferatu weakness, expressed above all else as one specific, unusual effect &mdash; the room quite simply goes cold when a Caporetto walks in.

And on top of that, no matter how he might try, a Caporetto cannot counterfeit life by spending Vitae &mdash; the cold wells up from inside the vampire&rsquo;s dead flesh, as if it were some active force rather than a simple absence of heat.

(13, 'Brothers of Ypres', 'A line of poisoners and masters of toxins, descended from world war combatants.', '> We’ve spent the last century poisoning ourselves. A nuclear power plant melts down in the Ukraine. A chemical plant explodes in India. One of the largest cities of the world near-collapses under the weight of its polluted air. And in the first World War, we found ever more efficient ways to poison each other. Every side propelled countless shells, full of deadly gases — phosgene, chlorine, mustard gas — onto soldiers who could do nothing more than pray that their battered, sweaty masks would keep them alive.\n> \n> And standing behind those in the trenches, the dead, who could not be poisoned, found ways to exploit these horrors. One dead man in particular, who bore the most mundane of names, learned how to internalize the poisons in the air, mud and water, and use them for his own ends.\n> \n> The bearers of his legacy survive, a line of monsters who thrive on toxins, under whose pale skin lies the chemical pollutant that has done its part in the poisoning of a century.\n\n**History and Culture:** A rolling cycle of death and boredom ruled the trenches, punctuated by the terror of gas attacks. Pvt. Owen Thomas Jones, a 19-year-old soldier from Barry, was reported as one of the 90 men who died in the chlorine attack on Hill 60 at the Second Battle of Ypres. At least that’s what he tells his childer: he says he was Embraced when he was already dead from the gas. Whether true or not — and very few vampires believe him — it’s part of his personal mythology, something Jones had a talent for.\n\nJones may not have enjoyed being a private soldier, but he flourished as a vampire. Within a couple of months, Jones managed to maneuver his sire into the way of a five-nine and was on his way across Western Europe, hiding among the troops by night and dwelling in the vast networks of trenches that the Entente powers developed across France and Belgium. He wasn’t alone in the vampires’ makeshift trench-society, and he soon became well-known in the mud-soaked Elysiums of the trenches. He was particularly good at taking advantage of the chaos and bloodshed of the various battles of the war. His enemies didn’t fare so well, falling prey, according to Jones, to shells, machineguns, barbed wire and sunlight. If Jones’s blood became potent particularly quickly, no one had the time to object. And if Jones’s Mekhet childer noticed that his aura had turned partly black, what were they going to do about it?\n\nJones thrived in other ways as well. Gas attacks didn’t bother the undead in the trenches. They didn’t need to breathe. Dead eyes couldn’t be blinded. Dead skin had no living cells to mutate and burn. Jones found the gas attacks to be an excellent cover for assaults on men who were going to die soon anyway. Jones began to develop a taste for the gas, for the blood of choking, poisoned men. He found, one night, that he had internalized the gas without even realizing he had done so. He found his taste for poisoned blood had become a need, but that he could use the poison for his own ends.\n\nIt suited most of his childer to benefit, with his help, from the same transformation of the blood. It was easy enough in the chaos for them to move on. Jones was always a loner himself, and when the war ended, he cut the members of his new bloodline loose.\n\nJones had Embraced men just like him: chancers and dealers, and they in turn had taken as childer people on both sides of the war. When the battles ended, they spread quickly with a speed that reflected the dizzying change that overtook the 20th century. By the beginning of the current century, they had become more numerous than any bloodline with less than a century of history has any business being.\n\nThey followed the British to Mesopotamia in the 1920s, and profited from the widespread use of chlorine on Arab and Kurd resistance fighters. Meanwhile, another branch of the bloodline gained influence on the battlefields of the Russian Civil War. They strode through the middle of gas clouds in Ethiopia and Morocco.\n\nIn the Second World War, one or two Brothers of Ypres fed well from some of the most callous evils ever perpetrated by mortals against their fellow human beings. And after the war, some even got as far as Japan, where the new kinds of poisoning visited upon the people by the bomb gave them more food than they had ever seen before.\n\nAnd so it went. The notorious London smogs of the 1950s that claimed so many lives were attractive to the Brothers, as was the disaster at Bhopal and the nuclear event at Chernobyl (in fact, power stations in general have been a desired place for Joneses to hunt). Lesser events, such as the poisoning of Camelford, the English village whose entire population suffered from aluminum contamination in the water supply back in the late 1980s, always seem to bring a Brother or two to hunt as soon as the news gets out.\n\nThe Brothers of Ypres themselves don’t seem cut out for working together. They cooperate happily with other vampires, but tend to see other members of the bloodline as competition for valuable food resources. It’s only when a poisoning event is big enough to create a regular source of Vitae for more than a couple of Jones that they appear in numbers. When they Embrace, they do it for a purpose, and don’t generally tend to tell their childer much about the bloodline. A lot of second- and third-generation Joneses (there are no fourth generation Joneses so far) seem to come into the bloodline spontaneously when their blood thickens enough, without being told anything about the limitations or benefits of their heritage. It has always been unusual, although not unheard of, for a Trencher to bring an outsider into the bloodline. The Brothers don’t need the competition.\n\n**Reputation:** The covenants and clans do not generally have a lot of time for the Joneses, and consider them more of a nuisance than anything else, not least because their power is so useless against the undead. They make the food supply taste vile sometimes, but the miseries they inflict upon the kine are not communicable. Yes, they’re not trustworthy — but who is?\n\nThe only thing that Owen Thomas Jones ever really passed down to his bloodline as a tradition is that the Joneses should only ever be seen to profit from toxins in their food — they shouldn’t be the cause of it.\n\nAnd it’s important for the reputation of the line that no one knows that a high proportion of Joneses keep stocks of toxic substances, ranging from cans of rat poison right through to the vats of Iraqi nerve gas Owen Thomas Jones added to his personal collection only a few years ago.\n\n**Concepts:** Over-zealous toxicologist, pest exterminator, Black Widow, war crimes suspect, experimental test subject, Gulf War Syndrome sufferer, fired UN weapons inspector, shell-shocked veteran, “unlawful combatant,” urban cyclist', 'Toxic, individualistic and opportunist', 4, 22, 3, NULL, 'MekhetBrothersofYpres-638d191ba0e26.webp', 'Jones, Trenchers', '<p>Along with the usual Mekhet clan weakness (see p. 109 of Vampire: The Requiem), the Brothers&rsquo; poisoned blood limits them to drinking Vitae from those who suffer from some kind of poisoning.

They died once and became vampire, and died twice and became Sta-Au. They are as much ghost as they are Kindred, as much monster as they are human. When one is made Sta-Au, his soul is cut like cloth into ribbons. His teeth are made into a mouthful of needles, his skin bears the stains of death and the marks of his wickedness. To enter the lands of the Sta-Au, the Land of the Worms, is to leave tranquility and to enter tribulation. They measure their wealth in the skulls they have taken from their victims.\n\nAt least, that’s what the Sta-Au would have others believe. Not all of it is off the mark, but it’s certainly an embellishment. The vampires of the Sta-Au are not truly twice-dead — no, this is a symbol, a warning that to meet the Wicked Ones is to die one way or another, and those who are allowed to continue existing within the bloodline are not considered spared, but reborn. They are not ghosts, not at all, but they can sense ghosts, as if they have been urged closer to the cusp of this mortal coil (close enough to see over the edge and to perceive the limitless dead that waits below). Their teeth do not transform into terrible, needled fangs upon becoming Sta-Au. They file them down to those wretched points, expending the blood and the will to keep them at their sharpest.\n\nIt’s true about their territory, though. The Sta-Au claim the places of North America that are dead zones, places that are forever marked as badlands by both truth and legend. Certainly this continent has become profoundly developed. Highways criss-cross the nations, cities spring up and cast a sprawling net of suburban wasteland, tiny towns dot the map. But it’s still home to distant places, places where mankind hasn’t gone, and perhaps won’t ever go. Places that man thinks he cannot survive: blasted canyons, bleak tundra, wide-open spaces said to be marked by terrible winters or awful pollution or searing heat. That being said, some Sta-Au carve out small territories in the midst of the cities, too. Even a large metropolis can be home to places humanity avoids. Places like a trash-heap, or a small island in the river (a “potter’s field”) where the nameless are buried, or an industrial park long left to rust and ruin.\n\nJust what are the Sta-Au, then? What is it they want with these desolate places? The Sta-Au seek to become more than what they are. They seek to alter the limitations placed on them as humans and vampires. They think themselves both punished for their wickedness and rewarded for being allowed a way to move past this corporeal state. They are, in essence, a misguided Golconda cult, believing that the path to becoming truly one of the gracious and wicked dead (as opposed to the “half-dead” that they are, now) is by exiling themselves in haunted dead-lands, letting their Humanity die off like fruit on a diseased vine.\n\n> **The sand hills**  \n>  The “Sand Hills” is the Blackfoot Indian notion of Heaven, kind of a “Happy Hunting Ground” reached for the true warriors of the tribe. For the Sta-Au, this idea remains, but has been perverted somewhat by their perspective as monsters. The Sand Hills are their interpretation of Golconda. Once they push past their awkward “half-existence,” straddling the worlds of life and death, they’ll be allowed to roam free in a blessed hunting grounds — the Sand Hills. They actually expect that their extant territories (the Land of the Worms) will change from the bleak and desolate places they are now into the sacred “hunting ground for glorious monsters” they desire.\n\n**Parent Clan:** Unknown, though likely Mekhet or Gangrel; some within the bloodline believe that it has two founders, one from the Tunaxa people, one from the Tunaha. That being said, once one joins the bloodline, that individual eschews clan as an identifier (and vampires of any clan may become part of this lineage).\n\n**History and Culture:** The story the Wicked Ones tell to their own is this: the origin of the Twice-Dead began with two men who were exiled by their societies. They came from different peoples (some within the bloodline suggest that one man came from the Tunaxa or K’Tunaxa, while the other came from the Tunaha/Tunahe) but were both criminals cast out for their wickedness. The story is quite clear on the point that neither of these men was dead at the time, and both were human and unfazed by the rising of the morning sun.\n\nSome stories have these men forging a deep friendship in the blasted hills and badlands where they met in exile, while other branches of the tale have them falling in love. Either way, their relationship was not long for this world as they were both dying: they had no food and little water, and the days were hot and the nights cold. And so, the legend says, they lay there, poised on the edge of this world and nearly ready to tumble into the next. All the while it was clear to them that they would not receive a reward in the afterlife. They would not be allowed to hunt the Sand Hills, for they were wicked.\n\nThis revelation spared them, the Sta-Au claim. Ghosts — wicked shades, dark shadows — emerged, claiming the two men as their own. The spirits consumed what was left of the two men’s human souls, leaving them as almost ghosts themselves. The ghosts said that others would join them one day, and that they would not be alone as Wicked Ones. Someday, they might be able to complete the transformation into something greater than what they already are, and then they will be allowed to hunt the Sand Hills. In the meantime, they are meant to stay in the dark places, the distant reaches, forever exiled from the world of man. These places — the Land of the Worms — are themselves “exiles” of a sort, pushed to the margins of this physical world, touching the very edge of the realm of the dead. (More information on the Land of the Worms can be found on p. 40.) And so it goes that the Wicked Ones are a curious (and to some, contemptible) breed of vampires that recognizes its own iniquity as a failing, yet also exalts such wickedness as being a path to not just enlightenment, but to a full-scale transformation of their condition. They are not a part of the world. The world is home to temptation in the form of life and humanity, and they seek to secede from such temptations.\n\nJoining them is not a passive affair. One is not slowly drawn into the web of the Wicked One, seduced for so long that one evening a character wakes up and finds that his blood is that of those around him. Joining is far more active. A vampire either seeks out the Sta-Au, or they “claim” a potential member by abducting certain Kindred who brazenly wander into their territory. Even then, they ensure that the abducted has a choice to join. Those who refuse are considered sad, and deserving of pity for being unprepared to transform (note: not transcend) one’s nature. A swift death is the mercy that is given to them.\n\nSo why seek them out? A vampire might track down the Sta-Au for a number of reasons, some true, some based on deception. If the character thinks them a group truly closing in on Golconda, and Golconda is his greatest desire, it makes sense to walk among them. Another vampire may have grown weary of hiding among humans. In recognizing one’s own base desires and sins, it isn’t unusual to want to leave the world of temptation and find a place and a people who are willing to help you realize your full, awful potential. (For some, that’s even a noble quest — “I don’t want to hurt these people anymore, but I cannot make myself better.” For others, it’s selfish — “I am a monster, and I want a place where I am allowed and encouraged to be that very thing.”)\n\nThose who join them are considered truly dead, so much so that they are given a version of a Blackfoot funeral where the prospective member is “left for dead” in a tree, covered from the sun only by a heavy swaddling of dark blankets, and put to the mercy of hungry carrion birds. Those who survive the process are allowed to become full-fledged “shades” within the bloodline, considered twice-dead and as much ghost as vampire or human.\n\nTimes have changed the Sta-Au, somewhat. Once, they were monsters kept to the furthest-flung fringes, and all they needed to do was hunt. More fiend than common beast, they stalked the lands they called their own, the Land of the Worms — and any animal, human or vampire that would dare to wander into their domain was quick to become prey. They’d consume the blood and use the rest for leather, or build weapons from the bones, drums from the skulls, or blankets from the hair. Should other Kindred enter the Land of the Worms, they’d first measure them at a distance. They’d warn them away, making it very clear that to continue on was to take a step into a very bad land. Believing that they were not monsters for the sake of monstrousness, they’d even attempt to give potential prey three chances to turn away, to save themselves from a vile fate. Those who dared to ignore the warnings (frankly, most everyone) were treated to the greatest of cruelties. Why shouldn’t they be? They were forewarned.\n\nNow, these incursions by outsiders happen all too often. The continent may still be home to some truly out-of-the-way places (think Saskatchewan forests, tracts of land high up in the Rockies, or long stretches of dead Mexican desert), but it’s not like it was 200 years ago. People stumble into the Land of the Worms with far greater frequency: lost vacationers, explorers, scientists, drug-runners, isolationists and so forth. This isn’t a bad thing, necessarily. It allows the Sta-Au to hunt within their territories far more frequently without sending out hunting parties (which they’re known to do — they aren’t bound to their territories), but it does ensure that they cannot be as exiled and isolated as they once were.\n\nPhysically, those of the bloodline have eschewed any native garb, though some elders still walk the world naked or dressed in very minimal deer leathers. Most mark themselves as monstrous in some way: filing teeth to points, scarification, branding, dizzying tattoos and so forth. Skulls are a common motif. Animal skulls are used as masks, or painted skulls like those found during the Mexican Day of the Dead are worn. (Skulls are also used as warnings, marking the edges of Wicked One territory.)\n\n**Reputation:** Few know of them, so it’s difficult to garner a widespread reputation. The Ordo Dracul is aware of the Sta-Au, and actually has a very loose alliance with those of the bloodline. They are given a pass to walk amongst the Wicked Ones so that the two groups may share secrets about the transformation of the vampiric condition (a few Sta-Au have even joined the covenant, but have done so against the wishes of the other Twice-Dead). Secretly, the Wicked Ones accept that the Ordo Dracul will never truly transcend or transform the Kindred condition because to do so necessitates a refinement of the Blood, not membership in a club. It’s true, of course, that the Coils *work*; the Dragons are theoretically on the right track. The Sta-Au, however, maintain that while the Dragons might be on to something, there’s more to finding the Sand Hills than dodging the Curse.\n\nOutside of what the Order of Dragons knows, the reputation that precedes the Sta-Au is one of mystery and urban legend. They represent one more grave warning whispered from sire to childe about the dangers of “going nomad.” Wandering away from the city lights puts one in the center ring of a circus of monsters, and the Sta-Au are just one more bogeyman out there in the dark.\n\n**Concepts:** Death-obsessed freak, exile from the Ordo Dracul, grief-struck loner, lost soul, Kindred nomad, unrepentant monster, vampiric embodiment of the Wendigo, scholar of atrocity, ghostly hitchhiker, hunter-turned-hunted', 'Wicked, degenerate and isolated', 4, 30, NULL, NULL, 'StaAu-638e5383c06ef.webp', 'Shades, the Twice-Dead', '<p>The vampire keeps her current clan weakness, but in addition suffers a debilitating moral and mental frailty: the vampires of the Sta-Au may not regain lost Humanity.

(15, 'Shepherds', 'Protectors of mankind from the Kindred, who believe that most of their kind have grown gluttonous and drink too much too often, risking the Masquerade.', '> Think of the way a shepherd tends to his flock. The herder watches over the sheep. He stays nearby, he directs them, he keeps them safe from wolves and starvation and disease. And then, when the time is right, he exploits the animals for their milk, wool and meat.\n> \n> That’s what the Shepherds do. These Savages stand guard over the food supply — that food being the human herd from which vampires feed. Admittedly, it’s not just about food, given that humans are powerful resources in ways beyond being just walking, talking bags of blood, but that still speaks to a core need to keep the herd relatively safe. Either way, whatever a human offers, he can’t be utilized if he’s dead or on the run. The herd is best when kept docile and ignorant.\n> \n> The Shepherds call this idea the “Fourth Tradition,” or the “Tradition of the Herd.” They claim that it’s just as important as the other three Traditions supposedly put forth by the Camarilla so many centuries ago, and that the Kindred have grown gluttonous and indulgent with the food supply. Any sense of moderation has gone out the window, and now the vampires let their Beasts have a taste whenever they see fit — often leaving a trail of bloodless bodies as a result.\n> \n> That doesn’t help anyone. The herd gets spooked, and then it withdraws. At night, they lock doors and windows. They don’t go out to the clubs as much, and the hookers all carry razors and Tasers and even pistols, none of which will stop a hungry vampire, but can all cause more than a degree of trouble. They call the police. Someone investigates the bodies, the blood spatter, the flakes of dead flesh left behind. They grow aware. Vampire hunters arise. The herd knows it’s being hunted. The Masquerade shudders and fractures.\n> \n> The Shepherds seek to stop this wanton disregard for the herd. And so they do what seems anathema to many Kindred: they protect the humans from vampiric excess.\n\n**History and Culture:** It began during the mid-19th century with the Montrose Party — a group of humans heading Westward toward Oregon. They were not alone. With them came a number of young Kindred, moving the “flock” of humans through the wilderness the way a cattleman might move his herd dozens of miles so the beasts could have grass to graze on. It was a curious experiment — neither man nor vampire had ever easily crossed such a wild expanse before. It was also a failed experiment: the Montrose Party was beset by a wild tribe of horrific vampires, seemingly not Kindred at all (the Sta-Au). Few survived, most perishing at the hands of the monsters, others claimed by them.\n\nOne of those who did survive and escape was Greta Devenpeck, a Gangrel who had a powerful way of blending in with the human herd, hiding in plain sight. Despite what was ostensibly a coldly pragmatic solution (usher the food supply to a place where the vampire herders could act as kings), she had formed a certain connection to the people of the Montrose Party — in much the same way as a keeper feels about a dumb hound or a stubborn herd of goats. Greta had come to know these people intimately. She’d discerned their quirks, watched their relationships unfold, and of course tasted their blood from time to time. And then, like that, they were all gone. Dead, because she and the others couldn’t protect them (couldn’t even protect themselves, truth told).\n\n> **White Hats**  \n>  The reality is, the Shepherds aren’t the “good guys” just because they keep humans safe. They’re basically just pragmatic predators, tending to the flock the way a cautious drug dealer keeps his customers from killing themselves so that they can continue to indulge their addictions. A parasite does best when it keeps the host alive, right?  \n>  Still, pop culture is home to a number of anti-hero protagonists, and Vampire: The Requiem falls in line with that idea from time to time. The Shepherds in particular can play — if you and your Storyteller agree — as something a bit more high-minded and heroic, if need be. They still play at being pragmatic predators, but in this more optimistic version, they’re actually unwittingly or willfully keeping the herd safe because they strive against the Beast within and the evils of Kindred society. They’re the bulwark against cruel predation, and thus you have a mode in which your vampire Shepherd can be more of a “good guy” than you’d perhaps find in a standard mode of play.\n\nIt was traumatic, and it changed her. Back in towns and cities, she found she could stand in a crowd of humans and they’d barely even notice her. The sheep did not see the wolf that stood among them in full sight. Years later, while on the East Coast, Greta came to notice things about people: sometimes, the herd would grow spooked. If too many fell victim to monstrous predations, they’d start to circle the wagons (so to speak), standing vigil over one another, shuttering the windows at night. Even a mote of awareness blooming in ignorance became dangerous, and when the vampires had trouble feeding, the competition over resources became all the fiercer. Fat and happy, the Kindred had an easier road to peace. Lean and hungry, they tore at each other like starving dogs.\n\nGreta and her coterie took it unto themselves to police the overindulgences of their kind. If they caught a Kindred slaking his thirst like a mad dog, leaving a trail of bodies, they came to that animal and did what anybody would do with a rabid beast: they gave it swift mercy with stake and axe. From Devenpeck and her coterie of Savages grew the transformed blood of the Shepherds. It’s why they’re more than just a small covenant of vampires. The Blood shifted within them. They are wolves who walk in shadow, they are hunters in darkness. But above all else, they are Shepherds.\n\nJoining is as easy or as difficult as making a mark on one of the local Shepherds. One must of course be judged worthy. If a Gangrel has given herself over to hungry excesses too many times, the Shepherds will cast her to the curb (or destroy her outright). But if she can prove her devotion to moderation, to the safety of the herd and not to her own raw desires, then they’ll give her a proper look.\n\nThe Shepherds don’t dress in any notable way, and in fact are purposefully non-notable. They wear non-descript clothes for the most part, and keep their hair and any makeup to acceptable but not extreme levels (unless, of course, the general fashions of an area suggest such a thing — the goal is to blend, not to be a dullard in a room full of fashion mavens, or a golf caddy walking amidst a gaggle of homeless).\n\n**Reputation:** Their reputation is, at best, mixed. Some value their presence. They can be a bit self-righteous and icy, and it’s downright spooky the way they often just appear (sometimes with two or three of them in tow), but for the most part they’re actually fulfilling a useful function for the good of Kindred society. Some Princes keep them on retainer, and make them a valuable part of “the organization.” Many Shepherds have even ended up as sheriffs and seneschals.\n\nThe problem is, most of the Damned aren’t interested in “the good of Kindred society.” They want to eat. They want to party. They want to fuck and kill and run and laugh. What the Shepherds warn against is something most don’t ever see — while a snowball effect does indeed occur when a vampire indulges in gross feeding excesses, most are too blind to really notice it. And, even if they do notice it, who cares? Blood’s the same two blocks over, so the vampire simply moves his hunting ground.\n\nAnd that attitude makes the Shepherds seem like sanctimonious conservationists of the most annoying order... which further makes them enemies to any Prince or Archbishop or pack of snarling nomads. It’s a bit of a vicious circle. The Shepherds end up hunted, but they themselves are capable hunters. Factions clash, and in the interim, the human herd suffers anyway. It’s a struggle the Shepherds must endure; truthfully, those of the bloodline have yet to safely navigate such troubled waters in most cities.\n\n**Concepts:** Embattled Prince, helpful sire, Kindred pragmatist, reserved glutton, self-righteous castigator, seneschal, survivalist, wary sheriff, trend-setter, penitent avenger', 'Pragmatic predators', 4, 36, 2, NULL, 'GangrelShepherds-638e6d5e69a23.webp', 'Watchers, Herders', '<p>In addition to having to endure the normal Gangrel weakness (p. 107, <strong>Vampire: The Requiem</strong>), the Shepherds also suffer from being too &ldquo;human.&rdquo; This doesn&rsquo;t actually bring them any closer to humanity, but instead casts them further from their own people and nature. As a result, Blood Potency is particularly difficult to gain. The vampire only receives one dot of Blood Potency per 100 years and the experience cost to purchase new dots in Blood Potency is now new dots x 10.

(16, 'Amara Havana', 'An Indian bloodline that believes it was created by the gods to protect the world from powerful demons, they are incredibly skilled militants.', '> It was one of the most heartbreaking things I have ever seen: Amara’s ruin smoking in the moonlight, the scent of gun-powder and rock-dust still hanging in the air, thick enough to taste, and beneath that blood and death-ashes. I was numb with exhaustion already, my strength drained to the dregs by nights of battle, and yet the sight struck me, wrung pain from me when I thought I had no more grief left to give. Amara, the heart of my people, lay broken before me, and I knew that the ash I tasted belonged to my sire, and my sire’s sire, and all of my kin, broken along with it. They would not have abandoned the ancient temple-sanctuary to be defaced and despoiled by foreigners, living or dead. They would not have abandoned our king to be slaughtered by assassins unless they themselves could fight no more. A wrathful madness seized me, and for a searing moment all I wanted was to kill — had anything or anyone been unfortunate enough to come upon me, then, it would have ended the night in bloody shreds. As I came closer, across the fields torn by horses’ hooves and artillery caissons, the furious madness ebbed away and an even more terrible anguish took its place. It was even worse than I had feared, than could be seen at a distance, the whole of the temple’s outer face was simply gone, pummeled to rubble and buried in the landslide caused by the wholesale collapse of the hill’s crown. Beneath my feet, the earth still trembled from time to time and the sound of falling stone echoed out through the wreckage, as the collapse of the temple interior had not yet finished. I knelt in what was left of the outermost court and could not even find in myself the desire to move as the sky slowly paled with oncoming dawn. I wept, and whispered quiet pleas for the souls of my dead, and would have stayed to join them, had not Narayan found me there and forced me to my feet, his hoarse voice insisting that all was not yet lost. It was true, though I did not believe him at that moment. The temple was not wholly destroyed. The deepest chambers survived, and were re-excavated and reinforced in slow and careful stages over many years. We return there now by hidden ways, to take counsel among one another, and to whisper our questions to the ghosts of the warriors who came before us, and to fear for the future of our people. Or, at least, I do.\n\n> Thus it is written in the puranas of the Amara Havana: The asura Mahishasura, blessed for the purity of his piety, the many austerities of his existence, and his unfailing adherence to the *dharma* of his kind, could be neither conquered nor slain by the hand of any god or man. The terror of the three worlds, he conquered Heaven and drove forth all the gods, whose weapons were powerless against him, and sewed chaos and destruction upon the helpless Earth. In secret, the mightiest of the gods came together upon the banks of the holiest of waters and offered to the universe their prayer: that the Great Goddess should send forth a savior in her own form, a warrior goddess mightier than any man or god, whose strength could save Heaven and Earth from ruin at the hands of the demon none of them could slay. Their prayer was heard, and from the waters she came with ten arms to bear the weapons that were powerful in her hands, and three eyes to see all that had befallen the realms of Heaven and Earth and the Underworld, and a tongue that wished to taste the blood of demons.\n> \n> The battle between the mighty warrior goddess and the pious demon shook the Heavens and the Earth, and raged from the sea to the sky, from the mountains to the plains, and across the length and breadth of the three worlds. For nine days and nine nights they fought with one another, neither able to claim victory, and the blood of the goddess and the demon rained down upon the Earth and the creatures that dwelt upon it, transfiguring all that it touched in the demon-haunted world. The men and women upon whom the goddess’s blood fell suffered from its touch, first with a terrible heat that burnt away their mortal lives. Then a terrible cold gripped their souls, and when they rose from where they were stricken, they were neither human, nor god, nor demon, but some part of all. A fierce hunger was upon them, a desire to sup upon the blood of the asuras who, following Mahishasura, had risen from the dark places of the world to slake their lusts upon the people of the Earth while the gods could do naught to aid or comfort those who cried out to them for succor. And so, since the gods were helpless, the new-born warriors, in whose veins ran the blood of both gods and demons, took up their arms for the first time to slay the despoilers of their world.\n\n> Thus it is written:\n> \n> On the tenth day, the goddess was victorious. Her blade parted the hideous head of Mahishasura from his shoulders and the asura armies that the fiend had drawn into his service fell back in horror and dismay, to be pursued and driven back into the darkness from whence they had come. Shining with the gentle light of the newest of crescent moons, the goddess descended into the broken, ravaged world and surveyed it with sorrow in her heart. As the last light of the day died, the warriors who wore her blood as their mantle came forth from the darkness in which they had fought and suffered and knelt in supplication at the goddess’s feet, to beg her mercy and her blessing. To them, she extended her hand and, laying it upon their brows, she found that she could not take back the change that had transfigured them — but she could acknowledge the value of what they had become, and charge them to keep and carry out the *dharma* of kings and warriors so long as they continued to exist. These first warriors accepted that blessing, that responsibility, and the name that the goddess gave to them: Amara Havana, the Deathless Sacrifice, who had offered their flesh and souls to the struggle against asuras and *adharma* and whose faith could no more perish than they.\n> \n> Thus it was written, and thus it remains.\n\n**History and Culture:** The Amara Havana hold themselves to be the literal descendants of gods (or, rather, a goddess) and of demons, the offspring of a war that raged thousands of years before humanity even possessed the means to record its history. During this dark time, the world was overrun with both *asuras* (immensely powerful spiritual beings who were neither gods nor demons, and which could be malicious or benevolent and were often both) and demons hostile to both humankind and the gods. These entities were released, from the prisons and vows binding them, by the demon king Ravana, through his own rebellion against the gods and the strictures of the universe’s ordered adherence to *dharma*. It was a time of great terror and strife in Heaven, Earth and the Underworld, the horror fueled by the fact that many of the mightiest demons were pious enough to have achieved divinely which protected them from death except by specific circumstances. Such was the case of the shapeshifter buffalo-demon *Mahishasura*, whose piousness and prayers to Brahma had been rewarded with a body that could not be slain by any man or god and who achieved the conquest of Heaven as a result. In order to defeat and destroy him, the three greatest gods — Vishnu, Shiva, and Brahma — offered their prayers to the holy river Ganges to bring forth a champion for the gods, and thus was born the goddess Durga, the warrior aspect of the great goddess Mahadevi. The mightiest of the gods gave her their most powerful weapons, the mountains gifted her with a white tiger to ride into battle, and she went forth to destroy the demon that could not be slain by any but a woman warrior.\n\nUnlike several other Indian bloodlines, the Amara Havana do not believe that their patron deity actually incarnated as one of their own in order to found their lineage. Rather, when the blood of the goddess Durga and the *asura* Mahishasura rained down from their battle in heaven, those who were bathed in that blood were forever transformed by the touch of mingled divine and demonic essence. When the battle between the goddess and the demon ended in her victory, she descended to the ravaged Earth to set in motion its healing. When the first vampires of this bloodline knelt to her in supplication and prayed for her blessing, she answered those prayers with a boon of great power. Mighty and compassionate though she was, even the goddess could not purify them of the demon-taint to their blood, nor could she make them truly immortal. Instead she set forth conditions by which death could claim them, rendering them immune to age or disease, and vulnerable only to fire and the weapons of other warriors. She also decreed that the tainted blood that had so changed them would be the strongest of their weapons, anointing them as her chosen warriors, the rulers and guardians of their people by night as the mortal *kshatriya* were the rulers and guardians of the day. Thus, the Amara Havana consider themselves, and all other vampires, to be a form of *asura*, neither god nor man nor demon, but an admixture of all three, who have chosen a way of righteousness and self-sacrifice for the sake of *dharma* and the life of the universe itself.\n\nThis history is recorded in the *puranas* sacred to the bloodline as a whole and, in general, they do not credit the attitudes of western Kindred concerning the unlikelihood of their origin. If the westerners choose to believe that there are none in the world older than a thousand years, their delusions are of no concern to those who know better. The eldest vampires of the Amara Havana remember Harappa at the height of its power. The eldest of their lineage hand down artifacts, bearing the tongue of the ancient Indus, to the younger generations. They keep faith with the *dharma* laid out for them in the *puranas* and vedas and, as far as they are concerned, this is all that truly matters. Some Kindred of this bloodline even go so far as to believe that the western Daeva clan descends from them and not the other way around — with these westerners being the offspring of those too weak to adhere to the demands of *rajadharma*, who fled the cradle of the blood to hide their cowardice. This attitude naturally does not much endear them to their western cousins. Among the Kindred bloodlines of India, the Amara Havana generally consider only one other bloodline to be their peer in terms of ancient pedigree — the Nosferatu Rakshasa bloodline, with whom they have enjoyed a relationship that has ranged from semi-amicable rivalry to open, bloody warfare — and only one to be their superior, the *kshatriya* bloodline of the Mekhet, called the Ananta Naga.\n\nIn strict truth, no one knows precisely how old the Amara Havana really are, though they, like the Rakshasa, claim a history that stretches back thousands of years beyond the accepted limits of early human history. Certainly, there were vampires present and active within the Indus culture back then, though whether any of the current Indian Kindred bloodlines are direct descendants of those vampires is debatable. In practice, the Kindred of India make those claims and very few in the world could possibly gainsay them — they accept that history as true and teach it to their neonates as fact, admitting very little debate on the issue. In essence, the Amara Havana have retained their own startlingly resilient and contiguous internal culture by virtue of a fundamentalist attitude about their own history, which has admitted no editorial or adjustment by outside social forces. While the Rakshasa were falling under the “civilizing” sway of the *brahmins* for the first time, the Amara Havana were refining their own understanding of *rajadharma* to a razor’s edge without the need of such interference in their internal affairs. While the *brahmin* Kindred would have their own kind and the westerners believe that all the foremost advances of vampire society can be credited to their account, the *kshatriya* bloodlines in general, and the Amara Havana in particular, know otherwise.\n\nThe nocturnal battles, that secured the safety of the *brahmin* Kindred to practice their sorceries and develop their philosophies, were fought by the *kshatriya*. The blood that watered the mountains and plains and forests of India flowed from the veins of her warriors, living and dead. The burden of rulership was laid by the decree of the gods on the shoulders of those most fit to bear it, and those shoulders did not reside in the *brahmin* bloodlines. It became, over a period of some five centuries, a matter of not inconsiderable grievance that the princes of the Amara Havana would take counsel with the *brahmin* Kindred, would listen to the religious teachings of the *brahmin* Kindred, and would willingly do the fighting for the *brahmin* Kindred, but would not permit themselves or their dominions to be governed by a sorcerer-priest from behind their own thrones. Where the Amara Havana held sway, they *were* the rulers.\n\n> **The Warrior of Warriors**\n> \n> The office of the *Chhatrapati* is as old as the kshatriya Kindred themselves, steeped in the martial traditions of the warrior vampires that cut across bloodline, loyalty and antagonism alike. The *Chhatrapati* is, in essence, the ruler of the entire warrior caste, the vampire who has, through dint of martial skill, political acumen, religious piety and personal magnetism, managed to claim the title in trial by combat or through the acclaim of the majority of the kshatriya elders. In times of danger, this individual becomes the strategos of the warrior caste, the general whose plans direct the actions of the kshatriya elders and their subordinates to meet their dharmic responsibility to protect the great mandala of Kindred society. In times of peace, the holder of the office wields considerable political influence within the counsels of the kshatriya bloodlines and does much to shape the balance of power between them and the *brahmin* bloodlines — with whom they are sometimes peaceful partners and sometimes vicious rivals. Even when the need is acute, the office of the *Chhatrapati* is not always filled. In fact, it is currently vacant. The last to hold the title was assassinated by Invictus agents in the 19th century and none of the surviving elders of the kshatriya bloodlines have yet proven themselves to possess the requisite social heft to claim the throne and keep it. The Ananta Naga, the pre-eminent kshatriya bloodline of the Mekhet, and the Amara Havana essentially traded claims to the title for the best part of a thousand years, the majority of all *Chhatrapati* coming from these two bloodlines, though the last to hold it was a Rakshasa. At the moment, there are three potential claimants, all of whom possess a valid case for their assertion. Ravindra of the Amara Havana holds claim as being the sole survivor of his lineage, which has produced no less than six *Chhatrapati* over the last thousand years and which was nearly annihilated fighting in defense of the previous holder of the title. Kalapriya of the Ananta Naga contests the claim on the grounds of the incompetence of both the Amara Havana and the Rakshasa in recent decades and the need for care and delicacy in the execution of current plans. Narayan of the Rakshasa holds claim as being the grandchilde of the last *Chhatrapati* and the foremost warrior of his remaining lineage. Contested claims of this type are usually resolved in trials by combat. No one has yet issued such a challenge, but many within the kshatriya caste believe it is only a matter of time.\n\nMatters stood thus at the dawn of the 19th century, when the great European powers began exerting their colonial influence on the Indian subcontinent. The influx of mortal conquerors brought vampire conquerors in their wake like carrion birds and, in the eyes of many with the *kshatriya* caste, conflict was inevitable. Unfortunately, malign providence worked against the native Kindred, including the Amara Havana: a number of powerful elders retired their positions, leaving untried successors to navigate the perilous social waters of newly colonial India, and the results were almost uniformly disastrous. The *Chhatrapati* resisted the siren call of sleep for as long as he could but, in the end, even he needed to lay down his sword. His retirement, and the subsequent internecine quarrel among the *kshatriya* over who should replace him, led to open bloodshed between all the major bloodlines and most of the minor ones, as well. The Amara Havana and the Ananta Naga joined forces to lesson the Rakshasa, whom they perceived as the lapdogs and puppets of self-serving *brahmin* manipulators, and then turned upon each other to settle the question of dominance between themselves once and for all. Before either could claim victory, however, the war was joined from another quarter: European vampires beholden to the Invictus and the Lancea Sanctum, as well as native pawns and traitors, attacked the embattled *kshatriya* bloodlines. Already weakened by the struggle with their traditional rivals, the Amara Havana were hit particularly hard by the European onslaught: whole lineages were wiped out root and branch, and many dozens more were driven into torpor and exile before the conflict finally ended with much of southern India under the rulership of conquering European princes.\n\nLicking their wounds in exile, the Amara Havana realized the folly of their own actions and moved to correct them. Over the next century and a half they formally sued for peace with the Ananta Naga, who accepted without conditions, and then made similar overtures to the Rakshasa, who were even more broken and embittered than they. As it happened, the Rakshasa were more than willing to make common cause and, together, they made a project of isolating and destroying the Invictus Kindred who laid claim to their former dominions — slowly but surely reclaiming and rebuilding the foundations of their power. Now, the Amara Havana and their allies are planning to extend their vengeance beyond the borders of India.\n\nWorking closely with Rakshasa infiltration specialists, agents of the Amara Havana have assumed an assortment of guises and have begun slowly introducing themselves into western courts in both the Americas and Europe. Frequently, an Amara Havana will travel in a Rakshasa merchant-envoy’s retinue as a bodyguard or other high-ranking servant whose position would allow for reasonably unfettered access to a western court. More level-headed members of this bloodline are assigned to merchant-envoy missions themselves. Once ensconced in the cities of their unwitting hosts, these infiltration teams gather intelligence, recruit reliable local sources of information, engage in the fundaments of Kindred intercultural commerce, and report their findings back to their superiors. When and if a target is selected for elimination, these teams will often be the means by which an assassin or group of assassins enters and leaves a specific domain; these infiltrators also arrange the particulars of travel and accommodations for missions, as well as providing a readily available source of assistance should greater force be required to complete a given assignment. Lamentably, the Amara Havana themselves are not the best of assassins, being prone to the sort of honorable behavior that would lead them to challenge an enemy instead of simply staking him and leaving him posted somewhere facing eastward five minutes before dawn. When, however, a coterie of *kshatriya* are assigned a task that involves a high degree of violence to an enemy’s servants — particularly his body-servants or other retainers of a martial nature — the Amara Havana are generally the ones best equipped to dispense it. True elders of this lineage consider vastly uneven odds to be an interesting tactical complication, not an insurmountable disadvantage.\n\nSome members of this lineage, however, have been known to go west, with or without companions, and simply never return. The world outside the rigid social hierarchy of the Indian Kindred is intensely seductive to many young, and no few old, vampires — particularly those whose ability to govern the passions left to them is somewhat chancy. Hot blood and occasionally poor judgment is considered somewhat excusable in youngsters of this lineage and should such an individual choose to abandon his duty to his kin and his *dharma* to wallow in the heathen fleshpots for a time...well, that can be understood, so long as he eventually returns, makes penance, and has some sort of advantageous connections or bits of information to offer in compensation for his earlier moral failings. This sort of behavior coming from anyone more than 50 years undead, however, is considered significantly worse than a transitory failure of ethics and such individuals can, at the very least, expect harsh penances in order to regain the purity of soul they have willfully defiled. Failure to return home and accept proper chastisement leads to only one outcome, though the Amara Havana are loath to use it. Expulsion from one’s bloodline (the social aspect of it, anyway; obviously one can’t literally have a bloodline removed) is generally construed to be a fate worse than Final Death by all Indian Kindred. Destruction is preferable to a declaration of *pariah*, outcast and untouchable by all. Only a handful of Kindred have ever suffered this fate in the history of the Amara Havana bloodline, but their lesson stands starkly in the minds of all whose missions take them far from home.\n\n**Reputation:** Among the Kindred of India, the Amara Havana possess something of a mixed reputation. On the one hand, they are undeniably *kshatriya* among *kshatriya*: they have refrained, for centuries, from taking the path of least resistance, of allowing foreign influences to mutate their clan culture, to abandon their traditional beliefs and adopt an ethic more suited to the changing face of the world. Traditionalist vampires have long considered them to be the rock to which other, less faithful lineages might cling and be sheltered by their willingness to bleed and kill for the sake of all their kind, keeping faith with their rigid and unchanging *dharma* even as the rest of the world erodes around them. On the other hand, that unyielding adherence to tradition can, and has, worked against them. When one’s enemy is dishonorable, treating honorably with such opponents becomes a fatal weakness. When the world changes and one refuses to change with it long enough, even the simplest alterations in the shape of one’s beliefs can become points of breaking strain. The Amara Havana, in this day and fallen age, are a throwback to ancient honor and glory — and are very, very fragile. The coming conflicts may either signal a return to power for the line, a remaking of unbalanced Kindred society in their own image, or finish breaking them once and for all.\n\nWithin the senior counsels of the bloodline, at least two distinct factions have come into being. The traditionalist elders of the Amara Havana have, for the most part, thrown their lot wholly in with those who wish to avenge themselves on the western Kindred whose conquest of southern Indian during the 19th century so ravaged the *kshatriya* lineages. These vampires are highly conservative in general, adhering to social conventions that were ancient before Alexander marched his armies to the Hyphases and nourishing their sense of grievance with the modern world like a man cuckolded by his favorite wife. The loyal opposition within the bloodline is, in fact, only slightly less conservative — but that “less” embraces such heretical notions as not picking a potentially unwinnable intergenerational war with the western Kindred to salve the bloodline’s wounded pride, not declaring those Indian Kindred who travel to the west for their own reasons *pariah*, and a general greater willingness to adopt such elements of the modern world that do not directly threaten the integrity of their clan culture. The unappeasable fury of the conservatives drives most of the bloodline’s current activities with regard to its involvement in the Southern Cities Alliance; but the loyalists, somewhat greater in numbers, exert a certain amount of counterbal- ancing influence, forcing a consideration of tactics, objec- tives, and, most importantly, consequences that many of the more bloodthirsty elders would prefer to ignore. As matters currently stand, neither faction has the numbers nor the continuity of influence necessary to completely undermine the other’s efforts. The only thing that could significantly alter this balance of power is, of course, the vacancy of the *Chhatrapati*’s throne. Should Ravindra, one of the most potent loyalist elders, feel it necessary to issue a challenge, the traditionalists would move to neutralize him, and by extension those allied to him, with a challenger of their own. On the eve of war it remains to be seen, however, if anyone — Ravindra included — desires to unsettle the entire *kshatriya* caste in such a way.\n\n**Concepts:** Genius chessmaster tactician, reluctant assassin, dumb but honorable muscle, individual of mass destruction, *dharma* rebel, hard-bitten veteran of the colonial wars, warrior poet, private military contractor with an agenda, Bollywood martial artist, ultraconservative culture cop', 'Unyielding, honorable and traditionalist', 4, 43, 1, NULL, 'DaevaAmaraHavana-638e832267c03.webp', 'Guardians', '<p>As with their parent clan, the Amara Havana have difficulty resisting the darker passions of their natures (see p. 105 of <strong>Vampire: The Requiem</strong>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, accepting membership into the Amara Havana forever stains the vampires with blood.

(17, 'Canda Bhanu', 'Indian bloodline that seeks to redeem mortals and Kindred alike for their sins.', '**History and Culture:** The Canda Bhanu consider themselves but one among many: they are of the bloodlines of vampires who, in the aftermath of the terrible war between the gods, the demons, and their own demon-tainted people, were chosen by the gods to bring healing to the world. In this they are at least somewhat humble, though the brahmin vampires, as a whole, are not at all meek. While they are, in total, the least populous of the varnas, they wield political and social influence that far outstrips their numbers — thanks to their exalted station as teachers, scholars, priests, and, perhaps most significantly, blood-sorcerers. Even among the brahmin, the Canda Bhanu are a small but vastly influential bloodline, and this prominence extends not only within their own clan but to others as well, owing to their skills as diplomats and politicians more than to any particular esoteric skills for which the brahmin are generally known.\n\nThis is because the Canda Bhanu are not what they claim to be, though even they have forgotten the truth of what they are. They are, in fact, the descendants not of a native lineage of brahmin extraction but from that of a refugee seeking a safe exile in their land: a Ventrue adventurer who fled Rome in the waning days of the Empire, escaping the consequences of his own poor decisions, of treachery that would otherwise have been resolved only with his Final Death. He escaped the Eternal City with the most loyal of his childer and servants, just ahead of his enemies, and took ship to the East. When he ran out of sea, he and his attendants fled by land across the desolation of the Hindu Kush, seeking a safe haven where no one knew his face or his name or his deeds. He found that haven in the great cities of India, teeming with mortal life among whom he could lose himself while he learned the lay of the land and the local Kindred society.\n\nIt required some time, and some effort on his part, but eventually he found his way into the counsels of the prince, who was a kshatriya of the Gangrel, and from there into a position as that prince’s close advisor, in preference of the brahmin counselor whose guidance he found an onerous imposition on his desire to make war with his neighbors. An elegant solution to their mutual dilemma was devised: in return for the gods’ blessings upon his endeavors, the Roman refugee would be permitted to dispose of the irritating brahmin as he wished.\n\nThus the Canda Bhanu were (re)born in an atrocious crime. The already tiny brahmin bloodline, their entire dominion residing within the grasp of a prince hostile to them, was systematically hunted down and devoured by the Roman, his kin, and his newly acquired native allies. None escaped to tell the tale, and, knowing the infamy of what he had done, the newly created paterfamilias took no chances in further hiding the evidence. Within a decade, he arranged for the deposition and assassination of the prince whose ambitions had enabled the massacre in the first place, along with his entire immediate brood and any allies to whom he might have confided. Eventually, time, torpor, and the helpful effects of native internecine struggles succeeded in obliterating any recollection of the original Canda Bhanu and what they had been, leaving only what they had become.\n\n> Thus it is written:\n> \n> The wars between the gods and the demons, and the armies of their chosen warriors, ravaged the Earth by both day and night. The suffering of all peoples was great. Famine stalked the fields, stole the food from the tables of kings and sages, warriors and farmers, and the starving multitudes cried out to Heaven for sustenance. Pestilence flowed through the cities and the towns, the great temples and the humble villages, carrying away first the very young and the very old, and then laying its baneful touch on all, that none lived to offer prayers for those who had fallen or aid to those who yet survived. Demons carried away the sons and daughters of men, to profane them with unholy lusts, and taught blasphemy from the defiled altars of the gods, to turn the people away from their dharma and bring the whole of the universe to unending darkness and chaos. This terrible war gave birth to the night-hunting warriors of the kshatriya and, in time, the cruel weight of its toil wore away at their minds and souls, until they were little more than demons themselves.\n> \n> The gods saw how far their night-warriors had fallen and shed tears of grief and despair. As the tears of the gods fell upon the blighted Earth, some among the night-warriors came forth to bathe themselves in these divine waters, seeking to wash away the stain of hatred and violence that the war had left upon their souls. At the sight of this, the gods knew hope again, for if the demon-tainted could still seek out righteousness, all was not lost for the world. One of the highest of all the gods left his seat of contemplation and descended to the soul-hungry night-warriors, who fell upon their knees before him in awe and worship, offering him prayers for the healing of their pain. To assuage the hungers of their flesh, he laid open his own veins and permitted them to drink deeply of his divine blood. To assuage the hungers of their souls, he took them apart from the world to the holy mountain where he dwelt, that he might teach them more deeply of the ways of righteousness and the path to conquering the demon-madness that lay within them. There they abided for many long years, learning the way from the great divine sage, and, when the hour seemed darkest for those left behind, they emerged again to offer the fruits of their studies to all the asura-children of the great war.\n\n> Thus it is written:\n> \n> The newly-born brahmin of the night peoples went forth into the world to bring the word of hope and righteousness to their fellows, to let them know that the war they fought was not the beginning and the ending of all things for them. Many at first refused to listen, for their anguish had blinded them to all but terrible despair, and many more had no desire to receive the teachings, for their hatred and their lusts were better served by base indulgence. But, for some, the gentle words of their brahmin kin were as a balm to the soul and in them they found healing and a path beyond war and suffering to a future unshackled from both. Slowly, the words that the sages spoke spread from the small circles of their first students, washing out like soothing water, making pure that which had been sullied, making whole that which had been sundered, bringing peace to that which had been at war.\n> \n> Thus it is written and thus it remains\n\nEventually, even the Canda Bhanu themselves forgot that their lineage had originated in treachery and murder, though both continued to follow the bloodline’s destiny like a bloodstain that refused to wash away. Bereft of the blood sorcery that had been the province of the name’s previous owners, the Canda Bhanu nonetheless maintained their brahmin social status, serving a succession of princes as political advisors, diplomats, religious advocates and social provocateurs, eventually branching out from their northern “roots” to take positions of great intellectual and religious prominence in the city-states of the south, as well. In the process, they became almost more brahmin than even other brahmin, cleaving to the native philosophies they co-opted for their own gain with something approaching a convert’s zeal and passing that zealotry down to their offspring, who perpetuated it down the line to the present. The social battles for dominance between the kshatriya vampires, who believed they possessed a divinely bestowed mandate to make war and rule according to the precepts revealed to them, and the brahmin, who believed they possessed the divinely bestowed right to overrule the dictates of even immortal rulers in order to promote the proper adherence to vampiric dharma, were the source of much of their influence. Few princes wished to rule without the imprimatur of the gods or the approval of the priestly caste, and the Canda Bhanu were among the most adept at ruling from behind the thrones of those who sought their counsel — and occasionally seizing those thrones for themselves. Their efforts, in particular, bore fruit in their extensive alliances with, and manipulations of, assorted Rakshasa kshatriya princes, many of which persisted deep into the 19th century and the coming of the European invaders to the Indian subcontinent.\n\n> **Karmas Retribution**\n> \n> None still undead tonight, including the “new” Canda Bhanu themselves, remember the original Canda Bhanu, the tiny, insular, extremely devout and scholarly Mekhet bloodline destroyed and consumed by the Ventrue invaders who claimed their name. The blood in their veins, however, does not forget what it is...and neither does the vengeance levied against that blood. When it became obvious that their doom was upon them and would not be denied, the eldest and most powerful blood sorcerer of the original Canda Bhanu lineage spent the last of herself in a terrible curse: that the treachery and murder that their killers brought to their doors would revisit itself upon them and bring them low, karma twisting upon itself to avenge the fall of the blameless and righteous. The act of diablerie that ended her unlife sealed that magic into the blood of her murderer and all his descendants. The Canda Bhanu are doomed to end as they began. Whether they will destroy only themselves or if they will take others down with them remains to be seen.\n\nThe European invasions created both conflict and opportunity. Pre-existing social pressures, within the rigidly stratified culture of the Indian Kindred, were coming to a boil as the perpetually fractious kshatriya caste prepared to enter into one of its cyclical changes of rulership, the pretenders to the office of the Chhatrapati lining up to assert their dominance over the others. Meanwhile, assorted factions within the brahmin caste were also contemplating changes in the society of their kind. It was the thinking of many brahmin — the majority of the Canda Bhanu bloodline among them — that for too long the stability of their society had depended on the violent whims of the kshatriya, who were becoming less and less biddable with every passing year, less inclined to accept the wisdom of their spiritual superiors. Certain overtures were made to a selection of European Kindred, certain communications exchanged, certain agreements put into place. When the kshatriya, as they inevitably did, ceased their preliminary “negotiations” and drew their knives on each other, the situation was ripe. The Canda Bhanu and their co-conspirators in the brahmin and vaisya castes passed intelligence to their European allies, disclosing the safe resting-places of a dozen torpid kshatriya elders, the temple-havens of dozens more kshatriya princes and influential ancillae, and then stepped back to allow the western mercenaries and assassins to do their work. The kshatriya were decimated in a series of swift, savage attacks that left many of the southern courts in chaos, deprived of their princes and many of their governing elders. Unfortunately for the brahmin, what happened next did not precisely unspool as planned: the European Kindred proved more than willing to extend the already treacherous situation to their erstwhile allies, as well. The Canda Bhanu, as the bloodline who had interacted most closely with the Europeans as a go-between and intelligence conduit, suffered the most directly from this turnabout. Never as populous as some of the older brahmin bloodlines, they and their dominions were ravaged by the invaders and their numbers horribly reduced by outright murder. Only one Canda Bhanu who claimed personal rulership of her own domain survived the assault against them, and even she was wounded almost to Final Death. Only a handful of the bloodline’s most powerful and puissant members survived to flee back into the north, exiled, their power utterly broken. The only consolation — and it was extremely cold comfort — was that the betrayal of the European Kindred had effectively obscured the culpability of the brahmin in general and Canda Bhanu in specific in the slaughter of the kshatriya caste.\n\nFrom their northern exile, the Canda Bhanu brooded on this reversal of their fortunes and considered their options, slowly nursing their wounds and nourishing their bitterness. Their Rakshasa allies, who had suffered heavy losses in both the kshatriya blood-war and the subsequent attempt to annihilate their caste, slunk out of the south to bring word of the Europeans, their strengths and weaknesses. The surviving kshatriya bloodlines, bloody and broken but fundamentally unbowed, began to coalesce again in knots of fury and unexpectedly robust resistance to further European expansion, though no single leader emerged from their ranks. A slow but steady program of retaliation against the European invaders and European princes who had seized Indian thrones began. The Canda Bhanu were gratified when the proud, fierce Amara Havana finally swallowed that pride for the first time in centuries, making their peace with the Rakshasa and consenting to take counsel with the brahmin, creating an alliance between the three bloodlines that successfully targeted and executed a series of vicious, precision attacks against their particular nemesis: the Invictus princes of the south. Though it took the best part of a century, eventually the European invaders were forced into flight, abandoning their Indian holdings and childer to the tender mercies of the kshatriya they had displaced. Now, in the 21st century, the Canda Bhanu, still bitter at the failure of their own treachery, still furious at being betrayed themselves, are at the forefront of the movement within Indian Kindred society to continue retaliation against the European Kindred wherever they now lair. *The honor of the blood demands it*, they say. *The honor of those who were betrayed and who fell, the honor and rajadharma of the kshatriya which were despoiled and defiled by the invaders, cries out to be avenged upon the defilers. If not now, when?*\n\nPoliticians and manipulators with few peers, the Canda Bhanu were also one of the handful of Indian bloodlines to expend any effort at maintaining those few connections they possessed with non-hostile western Kindred. These relationships are being put to work now. Younger members of this lineage, more likely to possess the necessary cosmopolitan mind-sets and educational backgrounds, have been sent forth to renew old ties of diplomacy and scholarship, the better to use those bonds to secure intelligence on their western enemies — and work subtly against the schemes of their erstwhile allies. In truth, the Canda Bhanu thirst to humble, humiliate and tame the kshatriya even more than they desire to avenge themselves against the western Kindred. Certain factions within the bloodline have begun undermining the efforts of the kshatriya to locate and isolate the western elders who attempted the conquest of India a century and a half ago, while other factions work to advance those goals. Eventually, something is going to give.\n\n**Reputation:** The Canda Bhanu have, among their own kind, a reputation for extreme piety. They exemplify the moral code of the vampiric brahmin: control of their emotions and the resistance of the darker heart of their nature, pursuit of truth and purity, extensive study of and teaching from the sacred scriptures, the offering and acceptance of sacrifice, and the performance of ritual. In fact, many among their own kind perceive the Canda Bhanu as not only being exceptionally righteous, rigidly so, but also more than slightly self-righteous –— the pride they take in their own unsullied purity, which they claim they maintained by preferring Final Death to submission to the European invaders, is particularly galling to the Amara Havana, whose elders suffered destruction in a considerably less ritually pure fashion.\n\nIn truth, the Canda Bhanu are treacherous, murderous, *extremely* self-righteous bastards, almost one and all, with a sufficient population of genuinely pious individuals to give their less tolerable kin a screen behind which to work. Furious at having been denied their opportunity to dispose of the intractable, ungovernable kshatriya — the primary stumbling-block to their own assumption of power — they are fully prepared now to finish the job they started a century and a half ago, manipulating their countrymen through the twin mechanisms of legitimate desire for vengeance and cultural guilt.\n\n**Concepts:** Diabolical mastermind, self-serving spiritual guide, manipulative power behind the throne, ultraconservative cultural judge, sadistic teacher, tragically true believer, wise old master, waif goddess, karma’s chew toy, rebellious scion', 'Self-righteous, treacherous and murderous', 4, 53, 5, NULL, 'VentrueCandaBhanu-639124f975194.webp', 'Purifiers', '<p>As with their parent clan, the power enjoyed by the Canda Bhanu inevitably corrodes and corrupts their souls, degrading the moral balance they struggle to maintain (see p. 113 of <strong>Vampire: The Requiem</strong>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, the curse that plagues the Canda Bhanu makes them especially susceptible to the powers of other Kindred.

In exchange, for the remainder of the year, members of the Apollinaire bloodline enjoy the abilities granted to them by the Ghede.\n\n**History and Culture:** Before the Haitian revolution, a vampire known only as Bokor Apollinaire grew to become one of the most influential Kindred of the first wave in St. Domingue. Apollinaire was a powerful houngan; it is said that he was favored by Ghede and that the vampire and loa came to an agreement that could benefit them both.\n\nTo hear the Apollinaire speak of it, Ghede was the first man who ever died. Since the dawn of Humanity, he has ruled over the dead and has controlled the gateways be-tween the world of the living and the dead. As centuries passed, Ghede grew exhausted from constantly maintaining the barriers between worlds. One night, he appeared before one of his most devoted and loyal servants, Bokor Apollinaire, with an offer.\n\n“I grow weary of my charge,” the loa said. “You have shown your loyalty to me, and are among the most powerful of my houngan. If you agree to carry my burden for one night out of a year, I shall bestow upon you and those of your blood great power.”\n\nBokor Apollinaire was honored to have been chosen by Ghede, and accepted the proposal. Ghede plucked out Apollinaire’s left eye, and planted magic in the empty socket, granting him the ability to see the dead. Then, Ghede bestowed upon his loyal servant the power to rule over the dead and maintain the gateways of this world and the next. For one night a year, Ghede relinquishes his charge and duties as Lord of the Dead to the Apollinaire bloodline. Ghede then walks the streets in the guise of a human, drinking, feasting, dancing and reveling flamboyantly in mortal pleasures. While Ghede is absent, the Apollinaire bloodline patrols the borders between life and death, fighting back the ghosts who attempt to cross into the world of the living while their master is absent.\n\nThe night of Ghede’s absence is not fixed. He may choose to leave at any time, delegating his duties to the Apollinaire bloodline. As such, Gatekeepers must constantly be prepared for his signal. To alert the Gatekeepers, Ghede causes a glowing vévé to emerge with a slight prickling upon the forehead of those who carry Apollinaire’s blood. The mark signifies the authority granted to the bloodline by Ghede, and is visible only to those of Apollinaire’s bloodline and to ghosts. Vampires who fail to answer the call of Ghede are punished by the loa by being thrown into Twilight and left to fend for themselves, often leading to the Final Death of the Gatekeeper.\n\nSome believe that Bokor Apollinaire met his Final Death during the Haitian Revolution, though members of his bloodline believe Apollinaire could never have died, having been the favorite of the loa of death.\n\nA Ventrue is recognized as a member of the Apollinaire bloodline once he has sworn to honor the agreement between the founder of the bloodline and the loa. A ritual is performed, during which the initiate’s left eye is removed and Ghede possesses the body of the vampire. The character gains the ability Eye of Ghede (see below), making him a true Gatekeeper.\n\nAlthough the Apollinaire are sworn to uphold the agreement between Bokor Apollinaire and Ghede, they are not required to take Ghede as their patron loa (see Kindred Vodoun on p. 73.), or, indeed, to become practitioners of Vodoun at all. While many choose to practice Vodoun, and the Apollinaire encourage new members to take Ghede as a patron, it is not mandatory. Once a Gatekeeper is acknowledged by Ghede as an Apollinaire, and he has sworn to take up the burden of Ghede for one night per year, he is free to lead his unlife as he pleases.\n\n**Reputation:** Because of the Gatekeeper’s connection to Vodoun (despite the fact that members of the bloodline may or may not actually practice Vodoun), the bloodline has a negative stigma for vampires who adhere to traditional European values. As such, the bloodline is often looked upon with disdain, or even tense apprehension, by the Invictus and Lancea Sanctum.\n\nThe Ordo Dracul is particularly interested in the Apollinaire, as the bloodline’s connection to Ghede has clearly shown that Vodoun can be an effective means of altering the vampiric condition. Gatekeepers do not appreciate being looked upon as the result of some de- monic experiment meant to be studied, however, and do not typically offer assistance to the Ordo Dracul without good reason.\n\n**Concepts:** Vodoun priestess, prison guard, wealthy traveler, vigilant guardian, eccentric magician, homeless vagrant, clairvoyant medium consultant, contraband runner, reclusive occultist, escape artist\n\n> **Eye of Ghede**\n> \n> Ghede is often portrayed wearing dark sunglasses with one eye out, to symbolize his power in the worlds of the seen and the unseen.

(19, 'Les Gens Libres', 'Anarchists and rebels, each Embraced as a form of salvation from some form of bondage.', '> Those of Les Gens Libres bloodline believe in freedom above all else. Members of the bloodline are Embraced from those who were subject to a cruel or unjust exercise of authority or power. Among their ranks might be a former slave, an ex-criminal, a prisoner of war, a man who has suffered a life of poverty in the hands of a corrupt government, or a battered woman trapped in an abusive relationship. In death, those chosen to become a part of Les Gens Libres finally find freedom. The Gens Libres are a rebellious lot, and they revel in their vampiric powers, seeing their abilities as tools that can be utilized to turn the tables on their oppressors and liberate those who are still oppressed.\n> \n> Members of the Gens Libres bloodline typically belong to no covenant, finding the very notion of an organized hierarchy oppressive. They operate independently of established systems, sometimes alone, but more often in groups, to further their cause. Les Gens Libres are vigilante freedom fighters — self-proclaimed defenders of those who are oppressed by authority. To Les Gens Libres, the world quivers in anticipation each night, waiting for revolution.\n\n **History and Culture:** Bloodline historians have never been able to pinpoint who exactly was the founder of the bloodline, but it is widely believed that the line is relatively recent in the grand scheme of things. The bloodline clearly originated in Saint Domingue (modern-day Haiti), sometime shortly before or during the Haitian Revolution at the end of the 18th century. Originally, members of the bloodline were Kindred turned from Haitian slaves, still burning with unforgotten hatred remaining from their mortal lives held in bondage. As the years passed, the bloodline grew to encompass a much wider range of cultural backgrounds — any of those among the masses who have been oppressed, and who believe in freedom above all else. Freedmen often choose to belong to no covenant, wishing instead to devote themselves utterly to their cause.\n\nWith the European tradition no longer threatened by the blasphemous practices of the Kindred of the first wave, there was very little left to do in Saint Domingue but systematically destroy those who remained. According to most records, that is precisely what happened.\n\nBut the truth is far more sinister where Les Gens Libres are concerned. Rather than kill the remaining Kindred slaves, the elders of the second wave corralled those who remained and developed a means of tracking their blood and the blood of any childe they sired. They bred out the Gangrel’s troublesome tendency to grow horrific claws, and instead they purposefully developed in the line an affinity for staying hidden — at least, from anyone who didn’t know how to find them. After the bloodline cemented itself, the founders of Les Gens Libres bloodline were set loose in the world to multiply. The elders of the second wave did this so that a new, relatively weak bloodline could serve as a food source for vampires who had grown too powerful to sustain themselves on human blood. Even tonight, certain vampires know how to use the tracking method devised by the Kindred of the second wave. The information on how to find Kindred of the Gens Libres bloodline can be bought for a high price by those influential enough to acquire it. The unpleasant truth of the Freedmen’s origins has, thus far, not come to light — or at least, no Freedmen still extant seem to know this truth.\n\nKindred who are initiated into Les Gens Libres must show their dedication to the cause by freeing a mortal (or, in some cases, a vampire) from some oppressor. An oppressor in this sense may or may not be a person. It may be a government, an unhealthy situation, or physical bindings, such as shackles or a prison cell. The fact the some people may not want to be free is, in most cases, a concept that Les Gens Libres cannot (or do not wish to) understand. They look upon those who willingly subject themselves to servitude as utterly deluded, and sometimes choose to end their lives rather than let them continue to suffer slavery.\n\n**Reputation:** In small numbers, Kindred with more traditional ideals generally see Les Gens Libres as nothing more than a loud and annoying nuisance. When their numbers swell, however, their strength becomes formidable, and not many are more adept at garnering support for their cause than are the Freedmen. As such, the bloodline tends to be closely monitored to ensure they remain contained and easily controlled.\n\nFor the most part, Les Gens Libres are on relatively friendly terms with the Carthians. Though their motives and methods may differ, the two groups both share a similar progressive attitude. The groups may occasionally find common ground and work together to achieve a mutual goal.\n\n**Concepts:** Vigilante, jaded ex-military officer, fervent patriot, rebellious teenager, disgruntled blue-collar worker, misguided rabble-rouser, guerilla warrior, falsely-accused ex-convict, zealous visionary, charismatic politician', 'Ex-slave', 4, 69, 2, NULL, 'GangrelLesGensLibres-6397cd994cbdd.webp', 'Freedmen', '<p>Members of the Gens Libres bloodline possess the weakness of their parent clan (see p. 107 of <strong>Vampire: The Requiem</strong>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, Les Gens Libres are incapable of forming a blood bond, and vampires who drink the blood of a Freedman are never subject to the Vinculum.

(20, 'Geheim', 'Hedonistic German aristocracy, with a penchant for pushing the limits of the Blood for all its worth.', '> Risen from the twisted households of the Austrian aristocracy, the Geheim seem to outsiders equal parts depraved extended family, bizarre esoteric society and cunning aristocrats. Never particularly trusted or popular, the Geheim suffered a public relations fiasco in the 20th century when it (its detractors claim) became involved in the Nazi Party. Tonight the family retains positions of prominence throughout Central Europe, spreading beyond the borders of former Habsburg holdings and bringing their syncretic combination of hedonism and alchemy to the rest of the world.\n\n**History and Culture:** Scattered throughout the ruling class of the Holy Roman Empire, the rise and fall of the lineage’s fortunes have largely mirrored those of the Habsburg family. Dilettantes claim that the founder of their bloodline, a Kindred known to his contemporaries as Count Geheim of Graz, was Embraced from among the sprawling Habsburg family. While the assertion has proven difficult for members of the line to substantiate, there’s little doubt that Geheim of Graz moved in the same social circles as the Habsburgs, as early as 1480. Personal correspondences among the Habsburgs across the centuries often mention a shadowy teacher or similar figure who matches the accepted description of Geheim. (The fact that these letters and diaries occasionally fawn over Geheim has been interpreted as evidence that he kept some of the writers under the bonds of Vinculum.)\n\nIn a ceremony documented by Invictus, Sanctified and Ordo Dracul records of 1577, Geheim and two childer, Cecilia and Volker, formally announced the formation of their bloodline, making a number of claims of entitlement regarding domains within Vienna and Switzerland — claims which they were apparently able to back up, despite the difficulty of travel during the period. Modern detractors point out that several of the locations claimed by the lineage boasted fewer than 1,000 mortals, making them poor possessions for any vampire.\n\nGeheim and his childer had already garnered a reputation for hedonism and excess, having hosted lavish parties for even the most lowly of visiting functionaries. While reports of baths of blood and bodies hanged from rafters are probably exaggerations, few scholars doubt the tales of woozy, blood-drained nobles stumbling to their waiting carriages after a night of debauched intemperance. The bloodline’s status as esoteric dabblers only began to grow after their official declaration in 1577. After acquiring territory in Vienna and Prague, they began hosting salons for the discussion of unusual and esoteric texts. These gatherings, which usually lacked the depraved self-indulgence of their parties, were not limited to attendance by Kindred, and numerous mortals of learning came to be regulars at Geheim soirees. Some Kindred even suspect that a few of the bloodline’s consorts were mages or creatures stranger yet. The lineage prospered, even through the anarchs’ war, somehow gaining new members and territories even as the rest of Kindred society collapsed about them. They became early and energetic advocates of the studies of the Ordo Dracul, assisting that covenant in its mission to find recruits from among the erudite and open-minded members of the Invictus and Lancea Sanctum.\n\nAfter the Thirty Years’ War however, the Habsburg House entered a centuries-long decline. The Geheim, once one of the most expansive Kindred families in Central Europe, with close ties to a royal line that held much of Europe at its height, found itself deteriorating in influence. The line continued to grow, but the power it had to share among its membership decayed. The esoteric work of the Geheim, once lauded as ground-breaking, became old hat, and while the ability to turn blood into gold kept the bloodline’s coffers fat, their tricks provided them little other help in the Danse Macabre. The group attempted to cope by infiltrating and creating numerous secret societies (a fact that furthered its reputation for witchcraft and infernalism among the Sanctified), utilizing their bloodline Discipline to gain high standing among the mortal adherents to the esoteric.\n\nThe most infamous of these organizations was called the Thule Society, created by a group of Germans in the early twentieth century. The group’s focus, the mythological pure race called the Aryans, drew the attention of the Geheim, who felt that exploration into the lost civilization of Thule might provide new sources of mystical strength. The Geheim had little chance to influence the Society before two of its members formed the political group that would grow to become the Nazi Party. While the Nazis renounced and disbanded the Thule Society, rumors of the connection between the Geheim and the Nazis quickly spread through Kindred society. The bloodline found itself less trusted and more loathed than ever before.\n\nTonight the bloodline still reels from its greatest political blunder, which occurred only recently as some European Kindred reckon history. Its three founding figures have all entered torpor, (though members of the line seem to be preparing to ease the return of Count Geheim himself in the near future) leaving the lineage to flounder listlessly without direction. While many of the eldest cleave to the ideals of the bloodline’s past, continuing studies into the unknown and infiltrating and manipulating the highest strata of mortal society, the youth of the line indulge themselves with an almost apocalyptic fervor. The fall of the traditional aristocracy has resulted in the bloodline becoming more closely associated with organized crime and corporate culture, and some of the line’s newest recruits have been garnered from the ranks of those groups.\n\n**Reputation:** As their sobriquet suggests, the Geheim have garnered a reputation for failing to fully devote their unlives to any cause. The lineage contains its fair share of spoiled, wealthy Ventrue, many of whom take the bloodline’s philosophy as an excuse to wallow in whatever excesses can hold their attention. The lineage’s deep connections to the aristocracy of Europe garner them only slight esteem and no small amount of derision; the Carthians object to such outdated social structures on principle (plus there’s the whole Nazi thing), while many Invictus feel that the Geheim simply don’t take full advantage of the benefits they are handed. Their love affair with organized crime infuriates the Sanctified (not to mention their study of alchemy, which the Lancea Sanctum generally labels as witchcraft).\n\nEven the Ordo Dracul, the bloodline’s chosen patrons, keep the lineage at arm’s length, viewing their discoveries with no small amount of skepticism. Thus far no one outside of the bloodline has been able to precisely reproduce the Geheim’s results. Most Dragons consider that evidence that the Geheim’s procedures reflect some strange quirk of their blood rather than verifiable scientific or occult principles.\n\nThe Geheim tend to join the Ordo Dracul with greater frequency than any other covenant. Not only do the Dragons value the bloodline’s abilities, but their position in the covenant’s history grants them a bit of freedom from the derision they almost universally face from other Kindred. Those who aren’t cut out for the Order’s psychological exercises and bizarre rites often end up with the Invictus, turning the covenant’s resources towards the end of feathering their own nest. Invictus Dilettantes typically make an effort to hide the greatest of their excesses and experimentations. Those who can’t even manage that occasionally fall in with the Circle of the Crone, which allows greater leeway for a vampire hoping to explore the full range of the Kindred experience.\n\n**Concepts:** Bloodline apologist, debauched celebrant, destitute aristocrat, hidden diablerist, lustful philanthropist, mad chemist, overbearing society matron, silent international business partner, vampire Mafioso, Vitae connoisseur', 'Hedonistic, blood addict', 4, 81, 5, NULL, 'VentrueGeheim-6397d8ec71c7d.webp', 'Dilettantes', '<p>The Geheim share the Ventrue clan&rsquo;s tendency to fall into madness (see p. 113 of <strong>Vampire: The Requiem</strong>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, the Dilettantes are obsessed with the applications and implications of Vitae.

(21, 'Septemi', 'Champions who seek to lead humanity away from evil, they are altruistic to a fault.', '> While the Sanctified have long claimed to be the most faithful and godly possible vampires, the Septemi exist as a relatively modern phenomenon set to challenge the covenant’s presumptions. Where the Sanctified attest that the Kindred were personally Damned by God to act as his lash against the back of a sinful mortal populace (thus driving them towards divinity), the Septemi spare the rod, declaring that vampires have no exalted place in the Lord’s creation. They work from the shadows to counter the influence of the Sanctified, driven by their higher soul to undo the work of evil men and lead humanity to salvation through charity and education. Such altruism dooms a Kindred to a difficult Requiem (often made more difficult yet by the fact that the Septimi’s altruism does not necessarily extend to their fellow vampires).\n\n**Nickname:** Passionate (among themselves), Maidens or Roaches (among the Sanctified — both derogatory terms)\n\n**History and Culture:** The genesis of the Septemi is a matter of some confusion. The ostensible founder of the lineage, Robert le Tuteur, served as a soldier in the army of none other than Jeanne d’Arc (known to English speakers as Joan of Arc) during the Hundred Years’ War (and in fact, some claim, received the Embrace on the third night after her martyrdom). He has since claimed that his introduction to the Requiem came at the hands of a Daeva elder who gave only the name Septima and that she told him of her legacy, a long line of Kindred who served God’s true will in the face of great perfidy. She set him on the path he would follow before vanishing into the night, intimating that she was the last surviving member of a bloodline that had existed since before the rise of Rome. No record of such a lineage can be found prior to Robert, however, and the fact that no record remains of any Kindred in France by Septima’s name or description at the time of Robert’s Embrace further muddies the waters (though, as many scholars point out, were Septima a Sanctified heretic she may have given a false name for her own protection).\n\nMost Passionate accept Robert’s story, but also claim that whether Robert inherited an older legacy or created the lineage remains immaterial to its overarching goals and beliefs. There can be no doubt that Robert serves as the single most important figure in the bloodline’s modern history, acting as a catalyst for the growth of a small movement of Christian Daeva unwilling to accept the teachings of the Lancea Sanctum. Robert taught his followers that Christianity applied to the Kindred as it did to mortals, and that their fallen state gave vampires no inherent dominion over the living. He rejected the terms Canaille and Kine, refusing to see the mortals as mere feeding stock, and ruffled feathers by denying many of “the pretty euphemisms” (as he put it) of the Damned. He drew to him numerous young vampires, many of whom he initiated into his own bloodline, though he purportedly sired no childer of his own. These schismatic Kindred drew negative attention from the Lancea Sanctum, but the covenant was too distracted by the mortal inquisition during the bloodline’s initial growth to effectively move against it. Misguided vampire heretics seemed a lesser problem than torch-wielding priests. Instead, they largely dismissed the heretics, branding them with the sobriquet “Maidens” due to the founder’s supposed association with Joan of Arc, the Maiden of Orleans.\n\n**Children of the Revolution**\n\nThe lineage truly came into its own during the waning years of the anarchs’ revolution. Among the mortals, the Catholic French backed the Protestant revolutionaries, initially through grants of wealth and eventually with martial assistance. The elders of the French Lancea Sanctum, eager to see the Holy Roman Empire fall into decline, followed suit, providing aide from their own coffers and stables of blood-bound servants. Yet their plan made slow progress. The Septemi had already entered the Empire, making every attempt to stop infighting among the Austrian and German Kindred and descending on destroyed mortal villages to assist in the rebuilding efforts. While the Sanctified would normally have dismissed the Septemi as minor thorns at worst, the Septemi began openly employing the signature mutation of their blood, a mystical ability that interferes with the supernatural, including the sacred dark miracles of Theban Sorcery.\n\nThe French Lancea Sanctum immediately became incensed, naming the entire line anathema and destroying all members of the group who surfaced within their parishes. Though some German Sanctified followed suit, the Septemi remained in Central Europe, working to undo the horrors of the civil wars both among vampires and the living. Yet, for all their work, the blood-borne selfrighteousness of the Septemi garnered the line few allies, and members quickly migrated. The line grew, spreading into Eastern Europe, Russia and Great Britain.\n\n**The Septemi Tonight**\n\nIn the centuries since their abortive crusade against the French Sanctified, the Septemi have made enemies almost everywhere they travel. Far from being heroes, their blood addicts them to the rush of martyrdom, the pleasure inherent in giving of themselves for an apparent greater good. The fact that many use less than noble tactics in their quests has done nothing for the lineage, and those Kindred familiar with the line label them hypocrites (and, more recently, terrorists).\n\nDuring the late 18th century, nomadic Sanctified began spreading a message within each domain they traveled to: the Septemi, they claimed, were an infernal threat that must be cleansed from the world. What followed were numerous bloody witch-hunts as suspected Kindred were dragged from their havens and rendered torpid. On occasion, the accused even stood trial before being left for the sun. The onus of proof, however, rested with the accused, and proving that one’s lineage does not include the taint of an obscure bloodline can be incredibly difficult.\n\nThe hunts were not terribly effective, however, and in most cases, trials simply served as an excuse for one elder to strike against a Daeva rival. Later Sanctified would call the Septemi “Roaches” for their ability to survive everything the covenant threw at them; the reality, however, is that the Sanctified largely undercut their own initiatives.\n\nTonight the Septemi still exist, often hiding in the folds of the Carthian Movement and keeping the truth of their lineage hidden. Few among the Sanctified still remember that they exist, though within those parishes perennially plagued by the Passionate, especially in Central Europe, the feud continues to simmer to this night. On those rare occasions that the Septemi openly display their presence in a city with any Sanctified influence, the church attempts to have them banished, destroyed or tried for treason against Kindred society. The wise Passionate never grants them that chance.\n\n**The Three Roads**\n\nThe Septemi lineage splits into three rough divisions, each corresponding to a member’s approach to the bloodline’s mission. The most active and aggressive division, the Justiciars, works to remove the tools that the Lancea Sanctum uses to keep humanity frightened and submissive. They observe local Sanctified, destroying connections with mortals through physical abuse and scare tactics (a gangster once loyal to a Lancea Sanctum bishop may be considerably less so after a visit from one of the Septemi) and directly physically assaulting the Sanctified only if all else fails. They usually veil their genuine objectives behind typical covenant and Kindred politics, so as to avoid giving away their true identities.\n\nThe second division, the Pacifists, strives to undo the horrors that the Sanctified inflict on the living by helping those who such vampires harm. If a Sanctified places a Vinculum on a mortal, a Pacifist attempts to break it. When a Sanctified priest keeps a city block under his rotting thumb, the Pacifist disseminates literature of hope and faith. Kindred of the bloodline consider the Pacifists the oldest philosophy within the line, and Robert le Tuteur, the founder of the lineage, has expressed personal beliefs in line with this faction on the rare occasions he has made his presence known to his descendents.\n\nUnlike the other two divisions, the Custodians often content themselves with minimizing their own impact on the living rather than acting to undo that of other Kindred. They hope to lead by example, demonstrating that the Kindred can survive without causing undue harm to the mortal herd. These Kindred can easily fall into an ascetic style of existence, but they tend to be the Passionate most likely to rise to positions of prominence within Kindred society (mostly by dint of stepping on fewer toes than the Justiciars and Pacifists). From there they guide their chosen covenant in a way consistent with the bloodline’s philosophy.\n\nA member’s sire has nothing to do with which of the three groups she falls into. Instead, her curse draws her to one group at the exclusion of the others. In game terms, a character’s Virtue determines which of the three philosophies she is most inclined towards. Characters with Justice and Fortitude usually join the Justiciars, allowing nothing (sometimes including their Humanity) to stand between them and their quest to end the evils of the Lancea Sanctum. Characters who uphold Charity and Hope typically join the Pacifists, believing that they cannot heal the world through harm. Temperate or Prudent characters, on the other hand, often join the Custodians, striving to curb their own excesses. Finally, the Faithful among the Passionate find themselves drawn to all three divisions, always choosing a path based on the nature of their faith but often acting as intermediaries between the groups. Exceptions do occur, of course, and a Maiden might pursue Justice through public works and government manipulation while another might Prudently plot out every aspect of her plan to destroy the local archbishop.\n\nYet the Septemi have little in the way of bloodline organization. The three paths are less factions of the line than they are personal decisions made by the Kindred in question. Most Septemi teach their childer a series of closely guarded pass phrases designed to help Septemi differentiate one another from the rest of Kindred society. These phrases usually resemble riddles, biblical passages, koans or sutras, but cannot be traced back to a written source.\n\nSires choose childer they feel will strive to improve the lot of mortals and vampires alike, but remain vigilant against Embracing those who lack the reserves of willpower necessary to survive the Requiem. As a result, Septemi come from many different walks of life, but tend to be those who possessed some interest in philanthropy or vigilantism in life (sometimes both, and the line boasts more than one self-styled modern-night Robin Hood). Thus a Passionate may be a former night-shift emergency room nurse, a disgruntled police officer or a gangster trying to clean up his neighborhood.\n\nSeptemi never inform a newly Embraced childe of her lineage. Instead they do what they can to raise the member in a manner consistent with the bloodline’s beliefs. These eachings tend to begin privately, but are of a largely secular philosophical nature. If the neophyte shows acceptance and interest in the bloodline’s principles, the instruction sessions slowly transform, becoming steeped in religion and baroque mysticism. If (and only if) the childe seems willing to take on the lineage’s mission at the risk of her unlife will the sire adopt her into the line (a similar initiation awaits outsiders who the line deems promising). After all, a failed indoctrination could doom the sire.\n\n**Reputation:** The Kindred consider the Septemi misguided and naïve at best and dangerous and maladjusted at worst. Neither the Invictus nor the Sanctified would knowingly shelter or admit a member of the bloodline except under the most unusual of circumstances. While the Invictus stops short of branding the entire lineage a heresy to be wiped out, the bloodline’s beliefs and tactics tend to directly counter those of the First Estate more often than not. The Sanctified, on the other hand, would see the Septemi wiped from creation. Their actions, sins in the eyes of Longinus, disrupt Kindred society and endanger all vampires, they claim. Some go so far as to declare that the abilities of the Septemi display an almost certain link to infernal practices, but few other Kindred take such accusations seriously.\n\nWhile the Circle of the Crone would be unlikely to admit a Passionate into its ranks (and the Passionate even less likely to apply for admission), the faith as a whole appreciates the Septemi. The lineage’s tendency to draw heat away from the Acolytes is welcome, though the Circle frowns upon the line’s adherence to mortal religion. Worse yet, in domains where the Sanctified don’t pose a problem to the mortal populace, the Septemi tend to turn their attention towards the blood witches, a group hardly known for its altruistic attitude towards humanity.\n\nThe Ordo Dracul rarely crosses paths with the Septemi. Each group has quite a bit to offer the other, however, and alliances do occasionally form. The Septemi, for their part, dearly covet the advantages the Coils grant (especially those that minimize impact on the mortal populace, such as the Coil of Blood); they do not, however, appreciate the grisly studies that many Dragons embark on in order to unearth their eldritch powers. The Dragons, on the other hand, find the Abjurism Discipline and its capacity for overcoming the various threats in the World of Darkness fascinating. As a result, short-term relationships between single Dragons and Passionate occasionally occur, but usually collapse when each finds the other’s approach reprehensible.\n\nThe Septemi assisted the anarchs during the troubles of the 17th century and aided the nascent Carthian Movement when it began to spread across Europe. While the line hardly has a position of importance within the covenant as a whole, its philosophies mesh with those of the Carthians more often than they do other groups. As a result, the Movement attracts more Septemi than any other covenant. While the average Carthian finds the Passionate’s dedication to Christianity unusual, few actively work against members of the lineage so long as they pull their weight. Given the bloodline’s weakness, members often rise above the call of duty.\n\nThe Septemi do possess one major claim to fame (and to the efficacy of their philosophies): The lineage’s founder, Robert le Tuteur, remains active to this night and is rumored to have achieved the much-debated state of Golconda. He leads a nomadic unlife, typically hiding his true nature (and masquerading as a neonate) unless forces conspire to inspire him to intercede in a situation. While detractors point to his supposed achievement of enlightenment as an obvious lie and bit of propaganda spread by the line to further its heresy, those who have met Robert report that there’s something about his pale blue eyes, long sandy hair and beardless face forever frozen at two decades of age that inspires belief. Others point out that a Succubus of his age certainly possesses a stunning mastery of Majesty. Whether tales of Robert’s spiritual puissance will be authenticated or disproved as a hoax remains to be seen.\n\n**Concepts:** Ascetic martial artist, Carthian investigator, ghetto Robin Hood, law in a lawless neighborhood, mob instigator, monstrous monster hunter, political activist, protest singer, suicide hotline operator, wealthy charity chairperson', 'Altruistic', 4, 89, 1, NULL, 'DaevaSeptemi-6397dbd6a900b.webp', 'Passionate', '<p>Members of the Septemi bloodline suffer the curse of the Daeva (see p. 105 of <strong>Vampire: The Requiem</strong>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike the majority of their brethren, however, the Septemi find that their higher soul pulls on them with the same strength, addicting them to works of grace.

(22, 'Corajoso', 'Portuguese discipline, originally composed largely of a once-mortal family, that developed gifts of telepathy to facilitate their shared endeavors when the voyages of their country spread them far apart.', '> Family unity is a strange concept in the minds of most Kindred. Between the passage of time and the Machiavellian schemes of rivals, mortal relations become a liability, merely a torturous reminder of a vampire’s breathing days, if he is lucky. Some Kindred, however, find comfort of sorts in the limited trust and familiarity that close relatives in blood are more apt to demonstrate than other Kindred — who simply share the same general characteristics determined by clan. Sires usually have a driving purpose behind a vampire’s Embrace, and childer can provide a backdoor to an enemy, should the childe become neglected or antagonized. The Corajoso not only found value in the relationships within any given vampire’s lineage, but they capitalized upon it.\n> \n> As the post-Crusades European nations sought to expand their capacity for trade with the Orient and explore the new lands they discovered in the process, the Kindred who existed among them risked their unlives for the prestige of discovering or founding vampire domains across the world. The Corajoso bloodline discovered that one of the primary difficulties in traveling the vast distances across the seas, whether the destination was to an established civilization or into the frightening unknown world, was the lack of communication and the substantial delay in the exchange of information. In many cases, even the most basic bit of knowledge sent to the correct individual could prevent future catastrophe or spur immediate aid... if only it could get there in time. With the relative unity of the Kindred of the Corajoso, their network stretched across the globe, allowing members of this bloodline to coordinate their actions through the mystical ties of blood and their unique expertise in the arts of the *Linagem*. Being a brood of Lords, however, ensured that there was certainly madness to this method. The bloodline was, after all, formed in order to ensure a legacy for the line’s progenitor.\n\n**History and Culture:** Throughout the 12th and 13th centuries, Portugal struggled to find stability in its own independence and identity. So, too, did a brood of Kindred spread throughout the regions of Portugal and Galicia (now part of Spain) to the north. The chaos of the tumultuous transitions in Kindred power across Europe combined with the constant bloody conflict with the Moors throughout the southern Iberian Peninsula. A Ventrue named Afanso had solidified a domain that, when combined with the domains of his two childer, encompassed much of northern Portugal and southern Galicia. As the Crusades came to a close, Kindred of Castille and Aragon organized themselves and pressured Afanso to fall in line with their iron-fisted rule. The elders knew his weakness; Afanso held a particularly strong affinity for the tiny nation and its peoples. When he refused to offer tribute, a strategically placed village would suddenly be missing most of its young men, or a fire would strike the home of an important noble. Before long, urged by his childer, Afanso submitted to the myriad of rules, tributes, and other demands placed upon his “sovereignty.”\n\n**Brave Origins**\n\nLate in the 13th century, Afanso vanished. His childer set adrift without his guidance and his lands open to any Kindred insurgent, he simply disappeared without warning or reason. Many of his superiors and adversaries throughout Castille and Aragon (then beginning to solidify into Spain) assumed that he had been driven into torpor by one of their own. Afanso’s childer tried to lash out at the powerful network of vampires descending upon Portugal, but had no long-term success. Alfonso’s fate was not what everyone assumed, however. During his decade of absence, Afanso had struck deals with mystics among the Moorish Kindred still resisting expulsion to Africa. In return for a future of relative safety in his domain, the strange Kindred among the Moors taught him secrets necessary to put his plans into motion.\n\nAfter Afanso returned to Portugal, his childer and their handful of childer quickly followed his lead. They did not attempt to regain their lost domains. They found a new purpose and plan for the future. Professing strength in unity, Afanso urged his brood into the arduous process of retaking their homeland — bypassing the traditional methods of influence and prestige. As fate would have it, the royalty of Portugal involved the nation in a series of naval expeditions that pushed Europe into an era of exploring unknown seas and discovering unknown lands. The new techniques of the Vitae Afanso had taught his childer suited this era perfectly. He considered himself blessed — divine, even.\n\nThroughout the following few centuries, the Corajoso thrived. Stowed away in ships’ cargo holds, masquerading as nobles and merchants, and taking on the role of intrepid explorers, the Telepaths spread across the world. They initially focused on the efforts of the Portuguese Empire, but they quickly latched on to the successes and results of other European nations as well. A disproportionate number of this bloodline worked among the Kindred who established new domains. Others sought out vampires of the newly discovered cultures, hoping to broker their secrets to the world (those secrets they did not hoard for themselves). The subtle arts of Linagem assisted them in ways that amazed other Kindred and roused deep suspicions, as well. Indeed, those secrets virtually ensured that the bloodline’s progenitor would indeed receive his legacy... and the consequences of the debt he had failed to fulfill.\n\n**Hubris Takes Hold**\n\nA bloodline of vampires capable of peering into others’ minds is especially untrustworthy, particularly among Kindred. As the Corajoso elders grew in power, they were faced with the problems of cementing their individual legacies while at the same time keeping their childer (and themselves) from Final Death at the hands of other, understandably fearful, Kindred.\n\nGreed, paranoia and fear motivated the eldest of the Corajoso. Each one of them harbored the terrifying awareness that their record of stealing the carefully hidden histories and secrets of other vampires would return to haunt them. The youngest continued to carry on with personal schemes and goals. However, those who had at one time held a closer connection to their founder turned towards the darker side of Linagem in order to protect themselves. Finding difficulty functioning in the ever-growing courts of Kindred society, they focused on the younger and more easily manipulated descendants of their own blood. With greater skill in the bloodline’s unique talent came an even greater affinity for the Lords’ ability to cloud and control the minds of their own childer, grandchilder, and occasionally those of even more distant blood relations.\n\nAt least as vicious and controlling as any other group of elder vampires, Corajoso ancients carefully arranged their pawns and more valuable pieces across the world and nudged them into roles suitable for the various elders’ plans and defenses. The ancillae and neonates geographically closest to their elders (whether those younger Kindred were aware of the fact or not) suffered the most diabolical acts of the bloodline. The masters of Linagem had resorted to using various methods of mind-control upon their younger descendants, forcing them to succumb to the Vinculum. On many occasions, the thralls continued such an existence without any memory of taking the Blood Oath.\n\n**Irony Divides**\n\nWere it not for the eventual necessity of torpor, this bloodline may have completely devolved into an incestuous breeding stock of withdrawn, paranoid monsters. Over time, however, various elders have been lost to the Fog of Eternity or to other more tangible foes. Some of the younger members of the line found freedom from their invisible chains and once again ventured out on their own voyages of discovery. As part of their intricate systems of control and continued shackling of the younger generations, many of the Corajoso kept a variety of Requiem Diaries, scattered clues, and hidden methods of communicating with other elders in their “secret dynasty.” Irony certainly finds a home in the domains of Kindred. The younger and newly liberated Telepaths now make use of those elders’ relics.\n\nThe Corajoso have become a bloodline of two widely varied philosophies. Most of the ancient Kindred of the line hold on to the older values; they use complex schemes of control and manipulation to hide from and defend against the enemies who they have accumulated over the ages. In turn, many of the younger Corajoso have taken the more offensive road. They endeavor to free those who have fallen under the control of their ancestors and scour the world for clues to their own history and their predecessors’ host of enemies.\n\nThe Corajoso have found homes in every covenant. Most of the older members of the bloodline hide within and function from positions of power inside the Invictus and, to a lesser extent, the Lancea Sanctum. Tradition, ritual and the relative monotony of those covenants suit the elders’ need to be vigilantly aware of their peers. On the other hand, most of the younger Corajoso turn to the Carthian Movement and occasionally to the Ordo Dracul. Aware of the value of the status quo the elders seemingly require, Telepaths among the Carthians take part in some of the most chaotic factions of the covenant. Modern concepts and tonight’s fluid society tend to be the greatest weapons in freeing others from the elder Corajoso shackles. The rare younger Telepath who does not feel a particular calling or obligation to “fix” the sins of their fathers tends to dive into the mystery of where their unique nature comes from and just why it has evolved into such a potent weapon. The Dragons are commonly the only vehicle suitable for exploring such questions.\n\nRegardless of age or place in Kindred society, the Telepaths’ talents and curses force them into certain roles. Most tend to be loners. Those who insist on taking part in a more crowded floor of the Danse Macabre tend to lead other Kindred through force and intimidation. Typically, individuals are Embraced into the bloodline because of their fearlessness, because they are visionaries of sorts, or due to their specific skills and experience in uncovering the hidden. Survivalists, private investigators and scientific explorers could easily find themselves brought into the ranks by younger Telepaths. Older Corajoso, by contrast, typically came from the strata of the wealthy nobles, influential clergy, and from the ranks of knowledgeable members of specifically useful cultures encountered during initial explorations of the “new” world.\n\n**Reputation:** Publicly, the Telepaths are widely distrusted. In addition to snippets of real knowledge that some Kindred might know about them, a number of rumors fly about as well. In domains where Corajoso vampires are known to dwell, one might hear tales of mass mind-reading, gained knowledge through diablerie, and insidious bloody rites of divination. Most Kindred in positions of power expel the suspect from the city immediately, but some call for more drastic measures. Telepaths have been tortured and coerced into sharing accumulated knowledge. Others have suffered destruction at the hands of princes demanding information that these Kindred are not omniscient enough to obtain. Especially paranoid princes order any Corajoso vampires within their domains slaughtered.\n\nIndividuals, however, are far more curious about the Corajoso. Handfuls of brave Kindred seek out members of this bloodline. Some of these vampires offer a variety of payments in exchange for information the Corajoso might possess or be able to discover about their rivals. Most of the time, the Telepaths tend to shy away from such contracts; digging up a vampire’s secrets usually attracts more trouble than simple payments or favors are worth. On other occasions, Kindred employ one of the Corajoso for finding lost sires or missing members of their coterie. Even this can be dangerous; Kindred do not take kindly to being found if they don’t have the desire to deal with old contacts.\n\n**Concepts:** Kindred genealogist, charlatan psychic, explorer of the urban jungle, sinister psychologist, dilettante, vampiric profiler, surreptitious blood-bonder, Age of Exploration apologist, stalking horse, werewolf photographer', 'Telepaths', 4, 99, 5, NULL, 'VentrueCorajoso-63a9ce94d893d.webp', 'Telepaths', '<p>The Corajoso suffer the same weakness as the rest of the Ventrue (see p. 113 of <strong>Vampire: The Requiem</strong>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, the Telepaths are constantly barraged by the psychic turbulence inadvertently caused by Kindred around them. Regardless of whether or not a member of this bloodline has learned the Linagem discipline, every one of them is distracted by the constant flux of other vampires&rsquo; connections through Blood Sympathy. Whenever a Corajoso is in the presence of two or more Kindred who are not of the Corajoso bloodline, he suffers from distracting voices, intermittent random hallucinations and rushes of emotion. Under such conditions, the Telepath does not receive the 10 again quality on Resolve or Composure rolls (though this penalty does not apply to rolls made to activate Disciplines, it does apply to Perception rolls), and Resolve is always considered one less when used as a defense trait subtracted from an attacker&rsquo;s roll (as with The Forgetful Mind power).</p>', 'You should be careful about spilling your blood.

(23, 'Adroanzi', 'Caretakers and gardeners of native Africa, this bloodline resents its condition, and holds deep spite for humanity and divinity alike for tasking them outside of heaven.', '> Long before western civilization had real knowledge of the African continent and the mysteries within, gods walked the earth. Sometimes alien and bizarre, these gods interjected themselves into the lives of the mortals throughout the area. They were known to take on widely different forms, and most of their appearances did not resemble the typical dark-skinned native African. Just as varied were the stories of creation each tribe or culture attributed to their patrons; some legends claimed that humanity sprang from the earth or grew from unorthodox parts of their god’s anatomy.\n> \n> The Lugbara were, at one time, a culture spread throughout areas including modern day Uganda and the Republic of Congo. They worshipped a god named Adroa, a being of two aspects, good and evil, his body split in half. Half of his form — one arm, one leg, one eye, and half of his torso — resided in their world. The other half existed in the heavens. He was tall and white, always looking like he was near death. His offspring were the Adroanzi. Also said to appear like they had only half of a body, they were visible when viewed from one side and vanished when turned to view the other.\n> \n> The Adroanzi had more contact with the tribes of the Lugbara than their deific parent ever conducted. They would protect the people from wildlife and malevolent bandits, they would keep watch over their chosen, and they would ensure benevolent harvests for the most worthy tribes. They were not, however, wholly benign patrons. Stories told by the Lugbara warned against trying to look at the god-children. A mere glance would infuriate the Adroanzi, prompting them to kill and devour the offender immediately. Even more mysterious tales were told of the homes of the Adroanzi. From time to time, the tribesmen would find groves of demented trees, full of perverted plants that could not be found anywhere else in their lands. Those who ventured into these groves returned with horrifying stories of venomous flowers, carnivorous trees and crawling roots. All of these plants dripped with blood, and were growing from or around disturbed graves and bodies of those claimed by the gods.\n\nHistory and Culture: Long before Europeans made their way into the interior of Africa and interfered in the affairs of the indigenous cultures, a number of vampires took the roles of gods. While many required their human subjects to perform various rituals or provide different tributes, most of them appeared to be often benevolent. Almost universally, this benevolence was simply given to keep the mortal tribes from fleeing or fighting back. Thus it was that the Adroanzi “cared for” the Lugbara tribes.\n\nA number of these supposed gods had a culture and a form of society of their own. Throughout central Africa, most of these vampires conducted games and competitions through their devoted tribes. Tribes would wage war upon each other, challenge each other for land and resources, and demand rights of breeding from the other tribes. In most cases, these tribes were simply going about their own business. However, the Adroanzi never left their subjects unmolested for long. They would command their chieftains, sour the local wildlife (forcing the tribe to migrate), or subtly instigate aggressions. With the intrusion of European outsiders, the tribes’ cultures began to change. Some were decimated by the invaders, some incorporated the teachings of others. Christianity, however, was the benevolent poison to the Adroanzi’s carefully cultivated Lugbara.\n\nThe Adroazni did not take well or adjust easily to the shifting cultures, introductions of new religions, and emergence into a larger world. A significant number of them perished in battles against the outsiders and a sizeable portion fell into torpor, hoping to be swept up to the heavens with the rest of the gods once revered by the people of Africa. Only a minuscule minority of these vampires made any serious attempt to integrate themselves with the Europeans or Asians, and with the world around them in general. The youngest and most impressionable, who did make the effort, quickly discovered a niche they could fill.\n\nThrough the decades and centuries of ruling the mortals from the position of gods of nature, they had accumulated a great deal of skill in manipulating plants. These manipulations certainly bore the mark of the vampiric condition, and there was one beneficial side effect to this practice. The Adroanzi became known as Lacrimists because their horticultural experiments produced *mandragora* plants more reliably than any other known practice. From these *mandragora*, the Adroanzi were able to extract quantities of *lacrima*. A rare delicacy among Kindred, Adroanzi were able to barter great favors and vast resources for their lacrima. It took very little time for a few entrepreneurial Lacrimists to make the transition into the societies outside of Africa.\n\nInitially, these vampires traveled with and settled near the Kindred who had first discovered them among the African tribes. Thus, they were most prevalent near colonies controlled by the *Grémio de Corajoso*. Where the Gardeners went, the *Grémio* forged mutually beneficial relationships. The guild protected the Adroanzi while they capitalized on their association with the peddlers of Kindred vice. Few knew of the Gardeners’ origins, and those with such knowledge rarely cared after their first sip of *lacrima*. A few of the fallen gods attempted to return to their old ways, especially those rare elder Adroanzi who had ventured out into the world. On the heels of mortal explorers, these vampires sought out cultures and civilizations that had not suffered the same dilution theirs had. Attempting to enslave new villages, manipulate other Kindred, and reestablish their divine place over mortals rarely met with success.\n\nThis time, in the relative public eye of Kindred society, the acts of a number of Adroanzi elders cast a shadow over the bloodline. They developed a reputation as maniacal monsters who threatened the Masquerade. When they did occasionally find success and enthrall a remote village, explorers and invaders swiftly put an end to the oppression. Most of the bloodline was hunted down. The temptations of lacrima became tainted with suspicion. The majority of Kindred who learned of the substance through dealings with the Gardeners suspected foul play. Most wondered how many vampires had become unsuspectingly blood bound to the African elders. Even the most reputable Gardeners ended up running from Kindred domains, fearing destruction. Memories clouded by torpor, information inaccurately passed from one generation to the next, and the passage of time eventually allowed them to return from hiding.\n\nModern Adroanzi differ very little from the members of the bloodline who existed centuries ago. They are consistently reminded of their divine origins and take great pride in the fact that they still possess their mastery over nature and the flora around them. Between the uneasiness they cause in social situations and their utter contempt for humanity’s decision to abandon them for Christianity, the Gardeners tend to isolate themselves with personal pursuits. These activities commonly involve the exploration of various types of mandragora and the varieties of lacrima they can produce, but they can also bury themselves in the past. Feeling such a connection to the divine spurs a number of these vampires to delve into their own history, searching for how and why they fell from the grace of the other gods.\n\nIf the Adroanzi are more prevalent in any single covenant, it is in the Circle of the Crone. Lost rites, connections to ancient gods, and bloody tradition certainly appeal to many of them. The rest of the covenants generally attract only small numbers of the Gardeners. These also tend to be younger members of the bloodline. Searching any path that might offer answers to their past and longing for stability in a group separated from Man, they spread across the other covenants. Kindred aware of the bloodline’s history are always surprised to hear about one of the Adroanzi joining the Lancea Sanctum. However, the Sanctified are, after all, certainly not like the devout Christians of the breathing world. Indeed, younger Gardeners are far more open to exploring the darker side of the Sanctified.\n\n> **Mandragora and Lacrima**  \n>  Mandragora (sometimes called “mandrakes”) are plants that have been infused with Kindred Vitae. They are not ghouls and do not have any sentience of their own, but they do have intrinsic value to many Kindred. These warped and perverted plants produce small amounts of a bloody sap known as Lacrima (also referred to as “mandrake tears”). Lacrima is a unique substance that Kindred may consume. In fact, due to its compelling taste and properties that allow it to be blended with human blood, the rust-colored sap is sought out as a rare delicacy. Creating mandragora is an exceedingly difficult process that takes months and requires specific conditions for the plant to transform into this aberrant thing.\n> \n> Mandragora and lacrima are discussed in more detail in Ghouls, but in brief: A plant can become a mandragora if a vampire feeds it blood for a long period of time. Not every plant becomes one (most die, in fact), and there is no set formula for how much Vitae is required to make the change. Larger plants require more blood, yes, but it’s possible that a smaller patch of greenery becomes voracious and sucks up whatever the vampire gives it, while an oak grows sickly and dies after only a few nights of the treatment. Mandrakes sometimes gain a bit of mobility, and slowly grow toward sources of blood, much like normal plants turn toward sunlight.\n\n**Reputation:** Most Kindred find the Adroanzi to be eccentric and deviant peddlers of their liquid sin. Some elder Kindred may remember the years of ambitious and egotistical Adroanzi insisting that they were the direct offspring of a god, but very few would have had (or currently remember) direct confrontations with the “lost gods” trying to reclaim their glory. That being said, they tend to be viewed as novelties; worth attention only when the tiny bottles of lacrima are being passed around. Kindred who choose to roam the wilderness might have the most need to raise a conflict with Adroanzi in their own territory. Wherever the Gardeners conduct their experiments with plants, the property or landscape is littered with failed attempts — dead vegetation that take years to decompose, pools of bloody, pulpy, putrid and liquefied plants, and aggressive, bloated insects that scour the area of any other, more normal, insects. These disposal sites and groves for experimentation certainly cause a taint on the land around them, scaring away wildlife and placing a strain on anyone who depends on that land.\n\nOn the other hand, movers and shakers within the Kindred community feel very fortunate when they can contact and maintain a relationship with one of the Gardeners. Simply possessing lacrima can elevate a vampire’s reputation; having a regular method to distribute tiny vials of the substance to favored allies can place a vampire’s admirers in awe.\n\n**Concepts:** Vintner to the elders, poisoner, herbalist, inner city pharmacist, drug dealer, graveyard gardener, god of the dead forest, monster of the woods, wood stake weaponsmith, African refugee protector', 'Gardener', 4, 106, 4, NULL, 'NosferatuAdroanzi-63a9d476469b8.webp', 'Gardeners, Lacrimists', '<p>All Adroanzi share the weakness of the Nosferatu clan (see p. 111 of <strong>Vampire: The Requiem</strong>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, the Lacrimists are exceedingly bitter about their place among humanity and their apparent denial from the residence of the gods. This twist of fate infuriated the first of the Adroanzi so much that none of the subsequent generations would be allowed to forget their loss of divinity, nor would they be allowed to forgive humanity for it. Any time an Adroanzi feeds, he lashes out and abuses his prey. Whether he gnaws and chews while he drinks, pummels over and over again, or physically disfigures the victim, the end result is the same. For each point of Vitae taken, an Adroanzi inflicts an additional point of lethal damage. This means that it is more difficult to feed while trying to be discreet, and probably also interrupts the mortal&rsquo;s experience of the Kiss. It is possible to avoid exacting this revenge, but the player must spend a Willpower point. This allows the vampire to feed from a single victim for a single scene without inflicting this additional damage.</p>', 'Many gods have been lost to the ravages of time.

(24, 'Kinnaree', 'Secret demon defenders of Thailand, they see themselves as the bloody guardians of their countrie\'s spiritual future.', '> Driven into hiding hundreds of years ago, the Kinnaree believe themselves to be the secret keepers of Thailand and the protectors of its Dharma. This bloodline of social monsters uses a combination of perfected bodies, poise and insight to hide among the Kindred of Thailand, waiting for their chanceto strike at their prey — namely any demon, monster or god who has outlived her purpose.\n> \n> As protectors of these traditions in the Free Land of the Thai, they preserve the Hindu and older folk practices that predate Buddhism. Having an earthy and ancient form of Crúac, they tend to be Acolytes though their western cousins rarely accept them. In many European Acolyte traditions, a Kindred is a “maiden” only up until the point where she kills for the first time. The Kinnaree consider themselves immortal virgins in the service of their Patron Demoness no matter how often they kill, and this sets them apart from Western Acolytes and often makes it difficult for them to find a place within their covens.\n\n**History and Culture:** Scholars tell the story of Banna, a thousand armed demon and devotee of Shiva who earned the gift of invulnerability from his patron for his dedication and penance. The stories say that the All Mother created a virgin avatar to destroy this menacing Asura once and for all. A girl slew the greatest demon of the age because it was her Dharma to do so. The Ramakien tells the story of Ravan, with his thousand heads, who was also a devotee of Shiva, and also gained from him virtual invulnerability. The Ramakien goes on to say that his sister, an Asura with long terrible nails, caused a war between her brother and the greatest king the Thais ever knew that ultimately ended in Ravan’s utter defeat.\n\nHistory and mythology treats these as dissimilar myths with no root connection. The Kinnaree, secret defenders of Thailand, know the truth. There is no difference. The virgin avatar was able to destroy the Asura Banna because she knew his secret flaws. Shurpanakha, the long nailed demon, manipulated her brother into a war he could not win in an act of revenge for her husband’s death earlier on. What’s more, to the Kinnaree, this virgin slayer and the demoness were one and the same.\n\nThe secret cult of Acolyte-like witches in Thailand worships Shurpanakha as a local and powerful Asura. However, the Daeva of the Kinnaree see themselves as direct descendents of the Asura’s blood and claim their history starts where she fades from legend. In the Kindred version of the story, Shurpanakha was a tragic victim whose Dharma largely involved the destruction of her own kind. A child, she was created from the soil by the All Mother and in child-like stumbling, fell in love and married. Still not quite a woman she was unknown to her husband’s marital bed and when her brother murdered him, she was left heart broken and vengeful.\n\nAfter her husband’s murder, she went to the Himmapan woods and preformed great and bloody penance to Durga. Being so young, and with penance so horrible, Durga looked at the girl with pity and restored the parts of her face she had slashed away and mended the skin she had burned in sacrifice. Durga asked the girl why she would show such devotion, and the child simply responded that she wanted to know what her fate was so that she could fulfill it with joy instead of sorrow. Durga was impressed and not only explained to the girl her duty, but granted her a gift to aid her in her quest.\n\nFor Shurpanakha, her Dharma was simple: all things must come to an end, even gods and demons. Because she was of the latter and gifted by one of the former, it was for her to know the Asura and the Devi — and when they grew bloated and stagnant with age, she was to destroy them. Her gift was the Embrace without a sire. The Kinnaree do not assume their patron and imagined founder was the first Daeva, just the most important one.\n\nKinnaree is a name taken from the Sukhothai half-bird women of the Himmapan forest. They were said to have protected and succored Shurpanakha after she received Durga’s blessing. They hold to two ideals: that the traditions of Thailand must be maintained or the greatest and most evil of the Asura will return from Hell and destroy the world, and that lesser earthbound Asura who have forgotten their place in the celestial order must be slain. All things must come to an end for the Wheel to turn and Kindred and other demons are no exception. This puts them into direct opposition with the Kindred monks of the Sakadagami order, though ancient agreements between the Kinnaree and the founder of the order prevent it from devolving into an all out war.\n\nThese Fawn, a Thai word for dance, have spent the last thousand years infiltrating and manipulating all levels of Thai culture, including the ritual dances so important to national holidays. In fact, the bloodline draws many childer from the traditional dancers, since the Kinnaree believe that an expert dancer physically experiences the history of the people of the land. A special secret telling of the Ramakien presents Shurpanakha as the puppeteer and true hero of the story, and only the greatest of these dancers are invited to dance it.\n\nIn the 12th century, when the Kingdom of Sukhothai was first established, the kings started sporting events around a marital practice called Muay Boran. This would later evolve into the brutal fighting form called Muay Thai. Among themselves, the Kinnaree claim that it was due to their influence with the King and the monks of the time that so many of the maneuvers are named for events from the Hindu Thai epic, the Ramakien. The brutal and athletic nature of Muay Thai appealed to the dancers among the Fawn and many of them took on its study, though mostly in secret.\n\nThe Masquerade is only loosely observed in much of Thailand, and this has been the case as far back as any elder can remember. Most humans live with the knowledge that the Asura and Devi of legend might exist, though few can report actual interactions with them. Still, erring on the side of prudence is always wise, and the citizens practice many folk rituals to appease or keep the old monsters at bay. Most Thai boys wear phra phrim, a protective amulet made using special recipes and spells, from an early age. While older mortal Buddhist monks make most phra phrim, the Kinnaree’s subversive hand is found in the fact that most recipes include the burnt ash of a temple’s oldest scrolls. After all, all things must become ash. In more rural areas, farther from the organized temples of the Sakadagami, devotees of Shurpanakha interact with the farmers and villagers. Here, the Kinnaree might even openly lead, largely recognized as priests and revered demons. Gaining good Karma by “making merit” is an old Buddhist tradition in Thailand, and often families invite monks into their homes and feed them as a way of helping everyone along the path to peace. In a dark and bloody version of this tradition, some rural households open their doors at night in an elaborate ceremony where the demons are invited to drink their fill in exchange for blessings in the season to come. Due to the rarity of this belief, these nights of “making black merit” rarely end in death. That would be wasteful.\n\nContrary to belief outside of the Sakadagami, the acolytes and their Kinnaree leaders are not strictly female. In fact, the worshipers of the old Hindu gods and especially those of Shurpanakha welcome male Kindred as a necessary balance. Many seasonal celebrations need male participants and in fact many older drama-dances were once composed of all male dancers. While that is rarely true today, male Kinnaree are granted many boons, including first feeding rights. In some rural areas, people believe that being fed upon by a male Asura is a part of fertility superstitions that might predate Hinduism. Outsiders analyzing the beliefs of the Kinnaree might see a direct conflict in concepts like preserving the magic and culture of the distant past, and destroying old monsters to make room for new life. This paradox, however, is not one the Kinnaree consider.\n\n> **Story Hooks**\n> \n> - The Anand family has just moved to Miami in order to send their son to medical school.

This is as true in Thailand as it is in the rest of the world, thanks to the need for extra secrecy among the Sakadagami controlled court.\n\nThey are not openly known among the Invictus, as any Fawn among them would be there in secret in order to destroy wayward Asura. To the Carthian Movement in and around Southeast Asia and in American communities with a large Thai population, the Kinnaree are valuable allies if not easy converts. To the small sect of Islamic Lancea Sanctum in the area, the concepts of being demonic are similar, but damnation and ignorance in the face of local religion have lead to active disputes with this bloodline and the Acolytes around them.\n\n**Concepts:** Seasonal dancer, Mauy Thai instructor, Carthian infiltrator, flagellant, elder hunter, monster hunter, long-nailed monster in the woods, overly curious historian, half Thai Army brat, second generation family defender', 'Muay-thai', 4, 117, 1, NULL, 'DaevaKinnaree-63a9f5663a8eb.webp', 'Fawn', '<p>Like their parent clan, the Kinnaree are joyfully in touch with their darker natures (see p. 105 of <strong>Vampire: The Requiem</strong>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kinnaree believe themselves to be Asura, or demons of Hindu tradition, and throw themselves headlong into that role.

(25, 'Mayarap', 'Buddhists who seek to earn karma for themselves and all of the Kindred.', '> The path to Nibbana, or Enlightenment, is paved with far more steps than meditation and denial. It is more complicated than putting on a robe and feeding less often than Kindred would like. It is largely about making merit, making right choices and leading the type of unlife a vampire’s Dharma demands. No lineage of Kindred understands this better than the Mayarap, descendants of the Naga King forever bound to pay for his deeds, and indeed, the deeds of all Kindred.\n\n**History and Culture:** After Asira, the Naga King, took up robes and became the Naga Monk, he fell into a deep meditative state, only stirring to dictate thoughts from his internal study to his closest and most devoted childer. While much of Asira’s Dharma was already determined by the time he converted, his childe Suna was not so restricted and was able to hone his blood to what he considered highly spiritual ends.\n\nSuna spent 20 years walking the woods of Thailand (then still called Sukhothai), contemplating his sire’s words and the secondhand lessons he’d heard of the Mae Ji. He slept in the soil, always under fig trees, and battled with his Beast and many demons in the woods. At the end of his danger- ous walking meditation, he saw a change in himself he could not fathom. Gone were the ravages of his demonic appearance and the mortals’ wise fear of him. Gone too was the bubbling rage that had underlain most of his unlife. Once changed, he returned to the Wat Ning to share all that he had learned and all the growth that he had accomplished.\n\nAsira, his sire, nodded almost sadly as he listened to what Suna had to say. It was then that Suna noticed that his sire’s face was still the terrible visage it had been in his old unlife. He saw that for all his time in contemplation and skillful thought, Asira’s Beast still sat close and nearly in control of his every action.\n\nHorrified, Suna asked his sire, “I do not understand. I practiced the Eightfold Path that you have taught me. I have followed all the precepts as you perform them and I would not know meditation except that you showed it to me. Why is it then that I have changed so much and you remain the same?”\n\nAsira thought on this at his childe’s side for three nights before he spoke with a forked tongue. He answered: “I have a great debt to the world in my karma, my childe. The crimes I have committed are many and perverse over hundreds of years. It might be that one lifetime of following the right path and doing the right thing is not enough. Perhaps a thousand lifetimes would be required for me to reach Nibbana. Perhaps a thousand family members making merit in my name would be enough for me to reach Nibbana. I do not worry, though. This, too, is impermanent.”\n\nSuna marveled to see his sire content with his fate of suffering, and wondered at the paradox of peace found in affliction. He meditated on this paradox for a month before deciding that it was a koan, a problem without a logical answer. Knowing this, he meditated further, and his intuition finally answered the puzzle.\n\nIn order for the Naga Monk to continue on in his path he needed a great many others seeking Nibbana to share their merit with him. Sharing merit makes merit, and so by suffering, Asira was able to offer many others the chance to make more merit, which was itself a merit-making act.\n\nWith this flash of insight, Suna understood his Dharma and how it tied into Asira’s. From that night on, Suna spent his unlife turning over rocks and seeking in gutters the lowest of the low — murderers, pimps and drug addicts, crooked politicians and actresses so vain that they believed their own lies. Suna, his childer, and his childer’s childer sought the most despicable among the mortal world, the people so very lost in illusion and ego that they did not even realize they were suffering. People whose crimes were so great a hundred lives serving under the Mae Ji herself would not grant them peace.\n\nOnce found, Suna and his growing family would strip them of mortal ties, Embrace them, and set them back on the path to right thought and right deed.\n\nSometimes new Mayarap want neither enlightenment nor all the responsibility that comes with it. Sometimes, newcomers simply aren’t cut out for the monastic unlife among the Sakadagami. Sometimes they resist, and sometimes their souls are just too dark to be able to change. At its most mild, resistance is met with the patience of the Bodhisattva. Time and kindness (a merit in itself) go a long way with most of the saddest dredges. In more extreme cases, older and more experienced members of the line are called in to inflict real and legitimate cruelty on the neonate, with acceptance of her role as the only out. (The Mayarap do not consider this a violation of free will because the neonate is still making a choice. The most important choices tend to be the hardest ones.)\n\nAt its worst, usually only a problem among converts to the line or late bloomers, those who are far too close to their final frenzy or utterly unrepentant monsters, the only solution is a tragic one. Not often, but when it is right to do so, the line will gather at a private temple deep in the woods, a Wat with no name built on the site where Suna first saw the change in himself. Once there, they take the irredeemable to a pit seven meters by seven meters by seven meters. He is asked once more if he would like to enter the stream and one night reach Nibbana. If he once more refuses or proves false, he is dropped down into the pit, shackled and unable to escape. The pit is covered with a grating of iron locked to the floor. The Mayarap say prayers and blessings to the unfortunate and leave him to his fate.\n\nThe roof of the temple there has a hole in it just large enough to fill the pit with sunlight not long after dawn. One elder, far along in his understanding of the Treasure of Anicca, stays behind in the room for as long as he can in order to observe the unfortunate’s Final Death. It is thought that at worst, the creature will reincarnate in Hell where he can fulfill his Dharma in another way.\n\nIn addition to the normal duties of all ordained, the Mayarap are expected to make as much merit as possible so that it may all be shared with their greatest ancestor, the Naga Monk. Great acts of charity, teaching Dharma, and providing blood for other Ordained is expected to such extremes that some find it impossible to satisfy the needs of others and maintain themselves and their own gracelessness, they are largely attributed with a level of supernatural influence they simply do not have. In more rural temples, they are given saint-like status, and some few do take advantage and cultivate that reputation.\n\nTo those heathens and nonbelievers, the Acolytes, the Mayarap are often considered “the problem” as it was their ancestor’s dogma that drove them underground. Laity who have had their less-than-enlightened endeavors interrupted or stopped by these do-gooders tend to seek first to discredit them, then to destroy them. The pressures to the Mayarap are endless.\n\n**Concepts:** Politically driven priest, sadistic teacher, hippy guru, former drug addict, farmer-cum-defender, ‘reformed’ Acolyte, doomed perfectionist, serial killer, ‘fair-minded’ blood merchant, guilt-ridden son', 'Buddhists', 4, 122, 4, NULL, 'NosferatuMayarap-63a9f9ed048ed.webp', 'Coiled Snakes', '<p>As with their parent clan, the Mayarap suffer from a quality of &lsquo;otherness&rsquo; that is so palpable that they have great difficulty dealing with social situations (see p. 111 of <strong>Vampire: The Requiem</strong>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, unlike the Nosferatu, it is no simple nightmarish monstrosity that sets them apart.

(26, 'Mystikoi', 'Mystics who seek to reunify all of Creation with the divine, they modify their own forms in an attempt to mirror that of god... by succumbing to frenzy and the inner Beast.', 'History and Culture: Byzantine Emperor John I Tzimisces, in power during Armenia’s decision to grant legal religious freedom to the dualist Paulician sect, encouraged an influx of members of the sect into Byzantine lands. With the sect came a small group of Armenian Kindred nomads devoted to the Lancea Sanctum, but possessed of a heresy similar to that of the Paulicians. These Kindred, almost exclusively of Clan Gangrel, had long eked out a furtive existence on the very edges of the Longinian world. Now in Christendom’s greatest metropolis, the sect came to the attention of the Sanctified authority who worked to absorb the nomads into their orthodoxy. With the exception of a pair of elder Savages, the Sanctified met with success.\n\nThe two Gangrel, however, found that their relatively easy new existence within the Tagma ton Xenon (the primary military group of the Byzantine Kindred) granted them a reprieve from the base struggle for survival, and they turned their attention ever more deeply to their spiritual explorations. Over time they sired a small brood, which devoted itself to furthering the philosophy of the line, and the group garnered a reputation for studious understanding and spiritual sensitivity that rivaled the Mekhet. The Priscus of Gangrel petitioned the Imperator to elevate the group to the rank of Theme. He did so, naming them Mystikoi and granting them exclusive feeding rights over a monastic order within the city so long as they kept safe the many detailed records of the Athanatoi. This action birthed a thousand-year feud with the Agonistes line (which had, until then, been the primary record-keepers and historians of Constantinople).\n\nAt the same time, the eldest Illuminated began slipping into seclusion, often wearing heavy robes to obscure the strange malformations taking root in their physical forms. Only among other members of the line did the Mystikoi leave their physical changes exposed, and within the fellowship the bizarre markings came to signify advanced spiritual understanding. The line withdrew from the Tagma ton Xenon and petitioned for membership in the Lancea Sanctum. They were rejected and took shelter instead under the aegis of the Athanatoi.\n\nThe destruction of Constantinople saw the scattering of the Mystikoi. Most traveled north into the Carpathians or east into Russia. There they became wondering priests, a role they were particularly suited to, bridging the gap between animist native Kindred and the monotheistic religious tradition that the pagans found so difficult to understand. In time, the Illuminated drew the attention of a Transylvanian vampire called Vlad Dracula, and the lineage became one of the early cornerstones of the Ordo Dracul, lending the covenant many of its ideals.\n\n**The Hidden Church**\n\nThe bloodline takes care to choose its childer from among the faithful and studious. The lineage respects scholarship and quiet meditation, tasks often at odds with the vociferous Beast of Clan Gangrel. As a result, members must be intelligent and willful enough to overcome the instinctual need to exist forever in the moment. Sires largely reject ceremonial trappings during the Embrace and entrance into the bloodline. They usually encourage childer to continue the research they pursued as mortals, but to add to it studies of faith and philosophy.\n\nThe Illuminated maintain a strange, uncomfortable relationship with their inner Beast. Mystikoi philosophy posits three levels of being: the physical, the intellectual and the spiritual, each a more pure pursuit than the last. Traditional Mystikoi faith upholds the Beast as the syzygos, the Divine Self, a spiritual guide towards transcendence. The Beast is that which is eternal within the Kindred, and thus more akin to the divine source than not. While the Sanctified pursue oneness with the archons, the Darkness’s jailors over his creation, the Illuminated step up the rung, setting their sights on the higher Unity. Through the secrets of Spiritus Sancti, the lineage communes with the hidden world. Most consider the spirits they encounter through the power to be higher beings, the spiritual counterparts to physical creation, and emulate them in order to become more like them. (The vicious behavior among spirits observed by elders of the line serves as part of the reason that so many consider their Beast a divine guide.)\n\nIn modern nights a schism has formed within the bloodline. Some members claim that the Beast, as a creation of the Darkness, serves primarily as a cruel warden over the jail of the adherent’s physical form. Furthermore, the spirits the Mystikoi venerate exist primarily as a reflection of the physical world. No understanding of the divine can be garnered from meditation on such base entities. These Kindred instead work to reject and chain the Beast, pursuing perfection primarily through the Coils of the Dragon and utilizing Spiritus Sancti as a tool of study.\n\nLike many older bloodlines, the Mystikoi have almost nothing in the way of an overarching organization. Their rejection of ritual as frivolous pomp results in a culture based primarily in the members’ understanding of how one goes about scholarship and study, an understanding that changes over the centuries. Teachers have a position of particular reverence within the line, however, and those who serve as Avus to bloodline applicants earn a great deal of respect.\n\n**Reputation:** The Mystikoi, though historically important, remain a small and insular bloodline in the modern nights. They tend to operate in separate enclaves, sharing their discoveries with one another and the Ordo Dracul. They rarely burden unbelievers with their theories and almost never proselytize. As a result, few Kindred have a strong opinion of them. They go largely unnoticed by both the Invictus and the Carthians, who simply don’t share their esoteric interests. The Circle of the Crone feels that the line likely began among their number but has become woefully misguided over the centuries. The Sanctified still consider them heretical, but hardly any more so than the Dragons who they associate with.\n\nMembers of the Ordo Dracul tend to hold the lineage in some esteem. The Illuminated not only focus their existence on the study of philosophy and esoterica (primary concerns of the Order as a whole), they were also the first lineage outside of Dracula’s to pledge itself wholesale to the Dragons in the early nights of the covenant’s history. To this night, the vast majority of the Mystikoi hold membership among the Dragons, while a rare few join the other major covenants. For their part, the Mystikoi work well with members of other lines and covenants, as they are often eager to learn more of the world around them in all of its endless variations and more than happy to explore the philosophies of other vampires, at least for a while.\n\n**Concepts:** Antiquities dealer, bizarre banker, Catholic priest-turned-Longinian heretic, drug-addicted student, esoteric scholar, New Age guru, science fiction writer, sorority sister, street corner preacher, weird scientist', 'Heretics', 4, 130, 2, NULL, 'GangrelMystikoi-63abaefdeda49.webp', 'Illuminated, Bureaucrats', '<p>Despite their scholarly bent, members of the Mystikoi bloodline suffer from the Gangrel clan flaw (see p. 107 of <strong>Vampire: The Requiem</strong>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, the Mystikoi possess a connection (and some would say a subservience) to their Beast that few among even the Gangrel know.

The Mystikos may not spend a Willpower point to resist a Discipline or other supernatural power that would force her into frenzy. The Coil of the Beast, too (p. 149 of Vampire: The Requiem), works slightly differently for the Illuminated. The first tier, Chastise the Beast, requires that the player spend the Willpower point to avoid frenzy before rolling dice, rather than allowing the option of spending after a failed roll. The second tier, Lure the Beast, does not waive the Willpower point requirement to ride the wave.

(27, 'Order of Sir Martin', 'A diseased order of chivalrous and law-abiding Kindred, who have sworn fealty to the Invictus and serve as their secret police.', '> The First Estate’s acceptance of the bloodline and knightly order known as the Order of Sir Martin comes as something of a surprise to most Kindred. Often described with epithets ranging from “unpleasant” to “scurrilous” or worse, the Knights of Sir Martin seem at first glance antithetical to the First Estate. They claim to uphold the law, never openly defying it and always adopting a stance of submission towards the authority of the Invictus, yet they seem constantly plagued by accusations of secretly flaunting the edicts of the domain and spreading disease among the masses.\n> \n> In truth, the Order of Sir Martin acts as a sort of secret police for the Invictus, willing to act in ways and investigate in places that the more proper members of the covenant could never sanction. The eclectic membership of the order opens it to Kindred who would never otherwise find a niche within the First Estate, while the covert operations it engages in on behalf of the Invictus allows its members to channel their most destructive impulses into productive avenues. The Invictus appreciates the Leper Knight’s unique talents and have kept them close to their breast for almost a thousand years.\n\n**Parent Clan:** Nosferatu; rumors persist, however, that the Order of Sir Martin can spread their foul disease to members of other clans, drawing them into the bloodline against their will.\n\n**Nickname:** Leper Knights (or more derogatorily, simply Lepers)\n\n**History and Culture:** The Most Noble Order of the Fallen King, more commonly known as the Order of Sir Martin, originated in the late 11th century, just as the Crusades first fell upon the Holy Land. Bloodline legend accredits the formation of the line to an ancient monster called Martin of Jerusalem. The Haunt, long blighted with deformities that gave him the appearance of a leper, dressed in rags and existed among the colonies of the diseased and infirm. Over the centuries he drew several vampires to him, most of which were Haunts whose curse had manifested in ways they felt too severe to allow them to exist within the framework of Kindred society.\n\nThe pilgrims of the First Crusade slaughtered much of the populace of Jerusalem, robbing the local Kindred of a once-plentiful herd. While his more erudite and sophisticated contemporaries fell into torpor, Martin adapted, moving among the mortal knights and spreading the diseases he had long carried within his blood. The population of hospitalized westerners rose, and Martin moved among the blighted knights, studying their philosophies and religion and melding it with his own understanding of the world. A few of the warriors proved too pleasing to release to the cold grasp of death, and Martin took on new childer, empowering them with his Vitae and teaching them his own brand of survival.\n\nBy the end of the 12th century, the lineage had grown to almost a dozen Kindred residing throughout the Holy Land. While a few were directly related to Martin, most were European monsters who had followed the Crusade east. Martin took such outcasts to his bosom, as he had always done, and taught them to move with subtlety and guile. Better to skulk, hide and survive within Kindred society than be banished to the wilds and fall to the rapacious monster within. Yet the line faced rejection, both from the local Kindred, who felt Martin had become too westernized, and from the Sanctified and Invictus that had followed the Crusade, who saw Martin as a local heathen and threat.\n\nMartin again adapted, adopting the organization of the knightly orders that accompanied Kindred of the two great covenants to the Levant. In 1183, Martin gathered his extended family and bound them together in an oath, christening his group the Most Noble Order of King Baldwin the Leprous (who was then the King of Jerusalem). After Baldwin’s death two years later, Sir Martin renamed his followers the Order of the Fallen King.\n\nThough the Leper Knights never gained the respect of the other knightly orders of the period, they both outperformed and outlasted the vast majority. Martin taught his followers to cleave only to the words of oaths, discarding the spirit for a convenient loophole. He taught them to defend themselves, not only with weapons and armor, but with the fear of the diseases they might have. Members of the line teach their childer the following aphorism, attributed to Martin himself: “Be so unpleasant that they cannot bear to look at what you are doing. Smell so of filth that they keep their noses out of your business.”\n\nThe lineage began haunting the various roads between the west and the Holy Land, feeding on the sick and infirm and spreading fear and loathing in their wake. The western covenants, too repulsed by the Order’s habits, failed to realize the wide-ranging network the Order had established. A dark reflection of the Knights Templar, the Order began trading in favors and influence, allowing a Kindred to provide a service to a Leper Knight in Europe for the promise of a later favor in Jerusalem. Nomadic Kindred leapt at the opportunity, allowing the Order to  \n garner wealth and power at a startling rate. Members of the Order printed notes with special seals that attested to what the traveler was owed by the line. The Leper Knights of the Levant even honored the writs of those few vampires who survived the arduous journey.\n\nWith Martin’s blessing, the Order melded with the Invictus in 1317. Since then the Order has grown in size, always clinging to the outskirts of Kindred society, providing necessary services that the majority of Invictus find too repellent to perform themselves. The Order continues to take in those who would otherwise founder in the Danse Macabre, teaching them to overcome their curse and work towards their own welfare rather than devolving into slaver- ing monsters.\n\nTonight the Order looks much as it always has. In Europe, where the bloodline boasts the most members, the Leper Knights organize into Chapters, each of which usually covers a small region (such as London and its environs). In areas with smaller populations, a Chapter may cover a larger geographical area, but never so large that the Chapter cannot gather four to five times a year or easily communicate. Nomadic members of the lineage, called Rovers, travel between the Chapters, providing information and aid to compatriots in distant domains. Thus the bloodline manages a rough communication system that spans Europe, allowing information within the line to pass between domains far more quickly than it does through other sources.\n\nIn the Americas, the Chapter system breaks down, and few such organizations exist outside of New England. More typically a small city may include one or two members of the line, while a larger metropolis may boast a small gang of Leper Knights (who often adopt a gangland attitude and fashion sense, if only to further their unwholesome image). Groups of Leper Knights (even the New England Chapters) in the Americas rarely communicate across the vast expanses of wilderness and don’t benefit from the same information network that their European cousins do.\n\n**Reputation:** The Order of Sir Martin has never enjoyed a particularly positive reputation among either its peers within the Invictus or in Kindred society as a whole. The Carthian Movement, especially, finds the Order distasteful. According to the Carthians, they serve as exemplars of the worst mercenary tendencies of the Kindred, willing to take any assignment, no matter how degrading, for whatever table scraps the Invictus throw their way. Most grating to the Carthians is the fact that many of the Kindred the Order takes on were vampires who the Movement was eyeing for recruitment.\n\nThe Lancea Sanctum and Circle of the Crone have eerily similar opinions about the Order. Both groups feel that the bloodline wallows in self-interest, rebuffing any opportunity for enlightenment or grace. In short, the line fails to uphold the will of God (or the gods). The Leper Knights don’t share the animosity, and in domains in which the Invictus has a strong relationship with either covenant, members of the lineage often attend mass or the solstice rituals.\n\nWhile Kindred of the Order of Sir Martin almost universally swear fealty to the Invictus, a rare few forsake the First Estate for the Ordo Dracul. Such Kindred are almost always elders who have decided that they want something more out of unlife than the riches that come with membership in the Invictus. These Kindred find enough familiarity in the Order to embrace it, and many become celebrated members of the Sworn of the Axe. Unfortunately, leaving the Invictus requires a Leper Knight to recant his sworn oath to the knightly order. The lack of reprisal such turncoats face often worries the Ordo Dracul, and the Dragons usually watch their new members with extreme care, making entirely clear what will befall them if the local Invictus begins showing signs of the Coils of the Dragon.\n\n**Concepts:** Anti-Crone crusader, apparent AIDS victim, disease carrier, doctor-turned-murderer, extremist militant, gangland tyrant, information broker, spy in a foreign court, unceremonious prostitute, urban cowboy\n\n**The Advantages of Membership**\n\nMembers of the Order of Sir Martin gain two advantages. First, upon entering the bloodline, the character swears an oath of fealty to his fellow Leper Knights. The Knights help one another regularly, forming a web of mentorship with a slightly different focus than the Invictus. As a result, characters who claim both membership in the bloodline and Status of at least 1 in the Invictus may purchase the following Merits at half the usual cost in experience: Fighting Styles, Haven, Mentor and Retainer. They do not continue to purchase Herd at half price, and this bonus does not apply at character creation.\n\nAdditionally, members of the Order of Sir Martin gain access to the following Devotions. Each is a closely guarded secret within the sect and never taught to outsiders.', 'Chivalrous', 4, 137, 4, NULL, 'NosferatuOrderofSirMartin-63abb66084400.webp', 'Leper Knights', '<p>Members of the Order of Sir Martin suffer from the Nosferatu clan weakness (see p. 111 of <strong>Vampire: The Requiem</strong>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, they are wracked with a foul disease that upsets their humors. Whenever a Leper Knight feeds, her player rolls Resolve + Stamina. On a failure, she vomits up an amount of Vitae equal to her Blood Potency or the amount of blood she consumed, whichever is less. This applies whether the feeding occurs in the course of play or falls to an abstract roll (see <strong>Vampire: The Requiem</strong>, page 164).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The regurgitated liquid remains human blood and carries no risk of Vitae addiction or Vinculum (though few vampires would risk exposing themselves to the Lepers&rsquo; taint, even for the heady rush of Kindred Vitae). It may be possible to consume the Vitae again, depending on the circumstances, though unless special care is taken, most of the Vitae will be lost (assume that in most situations one quarter of the Vitae vomited can be reclaimed). Licking vomited Vitae from the ground is not only disgusting, but also requires the Leper to roll again to avoid vomiting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the majority of the members of this line don&rsquo;t have horrific physical deformities (at least not in the modern nights), such malformations remain common enough to be considered part of many Kindred&rsquo;s stereotype of the bloodline.

(28, 'Iltani', 'Powered by anger, spite, and resentment, the wrathful and sorcererous Iltani bloodline distills these emotions into lethal poisons.', '> Dark sorcerers and subtle assassins, members of the Iltani bloodline are as clever, spiteful and venomous as snakes.\n> \n> They operate in stealth and secrecy, and are masterful manipulators and deceivers. Vipers are unusually adept at controlling their own emotions, and they cling to their anger in death, fueling and transforming its corrosive energy to suit their own purposes. A vampire meeting an Iltani for the first time could never hope to see or understand the depth of the seething anger that is forever just beneath the surface of her stoic gaze — at least, not unless she chooses to unleash her fury.\n> \n> The rare and highly specialized poisons the Iltani use to weaken their enemies are distilled from anger, spite and resentment. Kindred scholars speculate that it is by channeling this dark, emotional energy and transforming it through the Beast that members of the bloodline are able to harness their unique abilities. Whether or not this theory has any veracity may never be ascertained, as members of the bloodline are uncommonly elusive and secretive.\n\n**History and Culture:** The Iltani bloodline can be traced back to ancient Mesopotamia. The bloodline’s founder, Nanshe Iltani, was a powerful priestess of the Coven of Nanaja, and a consult to the Kindred royalty of the shadow empire of Babylonia.\n\nAccording to Kindred of the bloodline, Nanshe Iltani had a lover, Arahunaa, to whom she was deeply devoted.\n\nOne night, the En (a title for the Kindred emperor in ancient Babylonia) came to consult with Nanshe Iltani. When the En saw the beautiful Arahunaa, he immediately wished to possess her. Despite Nanshe Iltani’s desperate pleading, En Isiratuu took Arahunaa back to the royal temple to live at his side. Adding to the tale of treachery, Arahunaa went with the En willingly — preferring an unlife of royal luxury over the companionship of Nanshe Iltani. The cruel actions of Arahunaa and the En enraged Nanshe Iltani, and she vowed from that night forward that she would be the one to bring about their Final Deaths. She knew that she would never succeed in killing her betrayers outright and survive. Instead, she would be patient, using a subtler approach of stealth and sorcery, striking when the moment was right. It was Nanshe Iltani’s desire for vengeance that led her to uncover the secrets associated with her bloodline tonight.\n\nIn the years that followed, Nanshe Iltani devoted herself to finding new ways in which her powers could be used to destroy Arahunaa and the En, taking many solitary walks through the moonlit steppes and deserts of Babylonia to reflect upon her goal. It was during these travels that Nanshe Iltani was believed to have developed her affinity for the venomous, lowly creatures of the earth: snakes, spiders, insects and scorpions. That she was drawn to such creatures is not surprising, as she herself was poisonous from her own festering resentment. She found that she could call the stinging, biting creatures of the desert to her side, and even influence their movements. After a time, she uncovered methods of condensing and transforming her anger, through the Beast within, into potent venoms. Eventually, she made use of the creatures she called upon to act as vessels of her spite, using their stings to deliver her poison to the victim. While Nanshe Iltani did not succeed in discovering a poison strong enough to lead to instantaneous Final Death, her newfound abilities were useful to her cause nonetheless.\n\nOne night, Arahunaa appeared to Nanshe Iltani in a dream. According to her former lover, the En had developed a terrible, dark gift, the likes of which the Damned of Babylon had never seen. Soon, the En would be unstoppable, and the empire would suffer for it.\n\nSeeing that the news could be used to her advantage, Nanshe Iltani seized her chance. Feigning sympathy for her plight, Nanshe Iltani gave Arahunaa a scorpion with a poisonous sting to set upon the En. The venom of Iltani’s scorpion did not directly cause the deaths of Arahunaa and the En, but it was potent enough to indirectly guide them to their ultimate end. It was through Nanshe Iltani’s cursed venom, members of the bloodline claim, that the Edimmu of legend were able to gain access to the En, tearing him apart from within and then subsequently killing Arahunaa in the massacre that followed.\n\nIn the chaos that occurred shortly after the death of the En of Babylonia, it is unclear what became of Nanshe Iltani. Since then, however, her progeny have spread throughout the world, refining her techniques and passing along her secrets in low whispers to each new generation.\n\nKindred of the bloodline almost always choose to sire a childe from an individual who was resentful or bitter during his mortal life. Iltani encourage their childer to cling to their anger, to fuel and strengthen it, but never to allow their fury to show. If anything, a Viper appears void of emotion. It is through an Iltani’s ability to control her feelings that she gains her power — skillfully transforming and molding her vitriol into useful manipulative tools.\n\nInitiates to the bloodline must prove that they can control their anger. New Kindred are treated harshly, chastised and provoked until the young vampire enters a state of anger frenzy. The initiate must successfully “ride the wave” (see pp. 178-181 of **Vampire: The Requiem**) to prove he has the self-control required to become an Iltani.\n\n**Reputation:** Members of the Iltani bloodline are unusually guarded and secretive, even for the Damned. Many Kindred tonight believe that the Iltani bloodline does not exist at all, and that it is simply a legend from the long-forgotten past. Those who do know of their existence, however, fear them for their strange ways and deadly abilities.\n\nBecause many Kindred laugh at the notion of the Iltani bloodline’s very existence (and the Iltani prefer to keep it that way), members of the bloodline are excellent assassins. While some Iltani may be willing to offer their services as an assassin, it usually comes with a steep price. Vipers are much more likely to use their abilities to manipulate rather than kill. They prefer to stand in the shadows, watching as their venom slowly tortures or drives their victim to madness.\n\nKindred who know of the Iltani also know never to cross one. An Iltani never forgets those who have betrayed her, and she uses memories of past transgressions to fuel her anger. A vampire who betrays an Iltani may not pay immediately, but he always pays dearly in the end.\n\n**Concepts:** Kindred assassin, lord of the flies, manipulative sociopath, espionage agent, underhanded informant, stoic enforcer, herpetologist, power behind the throne, eccentric collector, mysterious apothecary', 'Angry, ressentful and poisoners', 4, 145, 3, NULL, 'MekhetIltani-63acaeb4d3ea4.webp', 'Vipers', '<p>The Iltani have the same weakness to sunlight that curses all Mekhet (p. 109 of <strong>Vampire: The Requiem</strong>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, an Iltani&rsquo;s Beast makes her blood seethe with anger and resentment, and never misses a chance to seize control.

An En must always remind himself of who he was before his union with the demon, however, lest he lose himself entirely on the path to greatness.\n\n**History and Culture:** The En bloodline takes its name from the Sumerian word meaning “lord” or “god” which was also the title given to the Kindred ruler of the shadow empire of ancient Babylonia. The En bloodline traces its roots back to a singularly puissant En, Isiratuu, who held regency over much of Babylonia for twelve thousand years. It is said that the founder of the bloodline gained a “great and terrible gift” from a dark stranger in a dream. It was this gift that gave him the strength and the right to rule over all. Kindred descending from the En are said to have similar experiences involving a shadowy being of some kind.\n\nMembers of the bloodline are born leaders, and, as most En would say, were obviously meant to reign due to their royal lineage. Many Emperors feel utterly justified in unceremoniously claiming positions of authority, and they expect nothing less than the utmost respect when they do so. Members of the En bloodline do not tolerate objection to their inherited supremacy, and, when it will not hinder his advancement, an En uses brutal means to make certain that contesting vampires are aware of that fact.\n\nA Daeva is recognized as a member of the bloodline when he is chosen by a “Dark Stranger” — a symbiotic demon called an alu. Alu feed off of the corrupt power of their Kindred host, and, in return, they assist those of the bloodline in their rise to greatness by granting them certain abilities known as the Gifts of the Alu.\n\nAn alu seeks out a Kindred host and offers a partnership. While any Daeva might be suitable, Alu tend to prefer Kindred descended from En Isiratuu, perhaps drawn to the lust for power passed on through the progenitor’s blood. If the vampire accepts the demon’s offer, he becomes a full-fledged member of the bloodline. The alu merges with the new Emperor, becoming one with his blood. As the demon feeds off of its host it increases in power, and the abilities it bestows upon the vampire become more formidable. The powers granted by an alu should be used carefully, however, as the En runs the risk of losing himself entirely by consorting with the demon (see Gifts of the Alu, below).\n\nEn Embrace often, but are relatively few in number because they typically do so purely to build up a support system of loyal followers. They are not fond of competition, and as such, En typically try to Embrace from mortals who others easily manipulated in life. However, because members of the bloodline are so focused upon their own advancement, they tend to frequently misjudge the strength and potential of their children. True En arise from these errors in judgment, as an alu can recognize innate potential for power even if an Emperor cannot.\n\nNew En surpass their sires to repeat the vicious cycle with each new generation.\n\n**Reputation:** En have a reputation for using corrupt methods to quickly rise to power, making them unpopular to all but their most devoted subjects. Diablerie is common among the En bloodline, and Emperors do not suffer the same detriments that other vampires would by committing such an act. Perhaps because of this, Kindred who know of the En greatly fear the bloodline.\n\nSome vampires, however, are more than willing to follow an En, as power often trickles down to those beneath. An Emperor can be most generous to those who serve him devotedly and acknowledge his superiority, granting favors and portioning authority among his supporters.\n\n**Concepts:** Corrupt politician, rising starlet, demanding father-figure, brash drug lord, deluded serial killer, condescending magistrate, cult leader, callous CEO, mob boss, arrogant aristocrat', 'Ruler', 4, 153, 1, NULL, 'DaevaEn-63acb7221c087.webp', 'Emperors', '<p>Like all Daeva, En have difficulty resisting temptation (see p. 105 of <strong>Vampire: The Requiem</strong>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emperors also tend to be intensely focused upon their own power and advancement.

(30, 'Usiri', 'Once servants of Osiris, this lineage has adapted well to modern times and they serve as purveyors of secrets.', '> The Cult of Osiris was dedicated to assisting those who knew that the brother of sleep, otherwise called torpor, was soon to come. They offered assurances that memories would be kept safe and that battles against the demons of the Underworld and the God of the Dead would be fought and won. The creator of the bloodline, a Nosferatu High Priest of Osiris, became concerned that their secrets could easily be stolen by spies from the traitorous Cult of Set or even from lands beyond Egypt. So he decided to make sure those secrets would be safe from anyone and everyone who were not of his blood.\n> \n> The Usiri, who called themselves the Warriors of the Dead, were quite different from what most other Kindred believed them to be. In reality, they were collectors of information, hoarders of that most precious of commodities: secrets. The rest of the Kindred of Ancient Egypt, however, saw the Usiri as their protectors and guides through the dangerous realm of nightmares and dreams associated with torpor.\n> \n> As far as non-Usiri knew, the Warriors had a twofold mission: to fight Kindred enemies in the dreamscape of torpor and to assist their Kindred allies on an undoubtedly difficult and often nightmarish journey through the Underworld. Those who awakened from torpor often found themselves being comforted by an attending Usiri priest, who would whisper to them of the glorious battles they had fought against demons and, in some cases, even manifestations of Osiris himself. These whispered tales were described by the Usiri in exhaustive detail, providing the newly awakened Kindred with numerous images and stories to draw upon.\n> \n> In modern nights, the Usiri have found a niche as information gatherers, Kindred psychologists and advisors to elder Princes who covet what the Usiri offer. Thus, the Warriors of the Dead have reinvented themselves. They still proclaim to do battle with the spirits of the Underworld and they continue offering to protect and store the memories of those Kindred who near their time of torpor. Now, though, they do so from a more secular standpoint. The ancient Egyptian god of the dead has no place in the modern world, it seems, and some ultra-orthodox Usiri fear that Osiris might consider them betrayers, and even go so far as to exact vengeance upon them for abandoning Him. This consideration has caused those Sleepers to take their own, memory-saving precautions.\n\n**Nickname:** Warriors of the Dead (ancient times), Sleepers (modern nights)\n\n**History and Culture:** Usiri was initially the title given to the High Priest of Osiris. Kindred who worshipped this particular god became fascinated with stories of the Underworld and with assisting Ra, the Sun, in its nightly battle to rise again each morning. The Usiri began searching for ways, through study and prayer, to protect the mind while the body slept and the spirit waged war on the Underworld’s demons. The Usiri became known as Warriors of the Dead, Kindred who would take and protect the memories of their allies as they slept. They were trusted among many ancient Egyptian Kindred (including followers from the Cults of Ra, Anubis and Horus, for example) and rejected by others (the Cults of Set and Thoth, whose followers feared the idea of trusting others with their thoughts more so than losing those memories to the fog of time).\n\nEverything changed for the Usiri upon the Roman (and Ventrue) invasion. The gods of Egypt were dismissed as mythology and the Usiri were decried as liars and tricksters. It was then that they made a pact among themselves to leave the waking domain and enter Osiris’s Realm. They agreed to enter voluntary torpor and vanish into the Underworld until such a time as the invaders had long forgotten them. They hoped that, by spreading their memories and histories among each other, through numbers alone enough of their history would survive the time spent in the Underworld. Until enough of them are awakened, the Sleepers bide their time.\n\nEnough Kindred in modern nights fear what they could lose should they be forced prematurely, for whatever reason, into torpor. The Usiri use this fear as a tool to gain positions of power within various Courts. They can be found in every covenant, whispering to whomever will listen to them, offering guaranteed protection from the brother of sleep and returning the memories handed over for safe storage. Fortunately for the Usiri, the information they help to protect will always be a part of them.\n\nIn their efforts to adjust to present time, the Usiri have begun making overtures to their ancient allies, the Anubi, and the re-awakening Bak-Ra, concerning the formation of a pact between their respective bloodlines. Whispers within the Circle of the Crone suggest that they, too, have been contacted by the Sleepers. After all, they have given up so much and have received so little in return. The Sleepers are snake-oil salesmen, except that their particular concoction is the stuff of nightmares. They continue to perform their rituals of memory protection, however, all the while collecting and storing every other bit of information they can to help them survive.\n\n> **An Usiri Truth**\n> \n> Before the birth of Christ, when preparation for the final sleep included both judgment and the actual journey into the Underworld, Usiri Kindred used their abilities to pretend at being real warriors of the dead. Any problems with a memory that was unrecoverable, for whatever reason, could be explained away as the wrath of Osiris or a battle lost within the dreamscape. Obviously, this rarely happened, otherwise the Usiri reputation as knowledgeable guides and steadfast protectors would suffer.\n> \n> Usiri of the present are faced with a much more difficult conundrum. Belief in the Underworld is no longer a given in modern nights. A vampire may indeed fear torpor enough to ask for Usiri protection, but that aegis might be from something that the Sleepers know nothing about. Usiri awakening in modern nights are therefore drawn to the occult and, specifically, to more recent Kindred history, in an effort to get “up-to-speed” on the fears and needs of their clients.\n> \n> The Sleepers are masters at making their clients believe what they want them to believe. The truth of the Usiri predicament is far more pathetic than a simple lie, however. The Usiri know that everything they are peddling to their clients is a complete fabrication. They manufacture magnificent Underworld battles and plant those thoughts, images and ideas into the minds of their clients. The members of this bloodline are aware of this and it is their job to continue to spread the lie, if only to keep their bloodline from being hunted down and destroyed by those who might take offense. They are the faux guardians of the dreamscape. Their existence is predicated on the ability to keep torpid vampires from losing their memories (and their minds). In this, at least, they offer a great service to many within the Kindred community, regardless of how they sell themselves.\n\n**Reputation:** The history of the Usiri has been lost, as far as most Kindred know. These days, they are thought of as either the protectors of secrets (by those who believe in dreams, the occult and superstition) or as con-artists (by those Kindred with mental abilities who aren’t so swayed by the power of dreams or the threat of losing precious memories). At this point in the modern Requiem, there are simply too few of them to make an accurate assessment of the bloodline as a whole, although if they are capable of even half of what they claim, there might be reason to worry. The Usiri bring into question the entire notion of what is real and what isn’t — a vampire might ask, are the thoughts in my head my thoughts or were they placed there by someone else?\n\n**Concepts:** Court advisor, bodyguard, dream interpreter, spy/information gatherer, occult instructor, new-age guru, private detective, Egyptologist, archeologist, Kindred psychologist', 'Con artist', 4, 161, 4, NULL, 'NosferatuUsiri-63acbccd37814.webp', 'Warriors of the Dead, Sleepers', '<p>Usiri suffer the Nosferatu clan weakness (see p. 111 of <strong>Vampire: The Requiem</strong>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, the Usiri truly believe that whenever they fall asleep, they enter the Underworld to do battle with the demons and horrors that exist there.

(31, 'Bak-Ra', 'Worshippers of the Egyptian god of the sun who fled the Roman conquest by entering into millenia-spanning torpor, those few members of this bloodline who have been reawakened have set to re-establishing their fanatical cult.', 'The Bak-Ra (literally, Servants of Ra) were once leaders of a great society of Kindred. They united the clans of Ancient Egypt when solidarity was needed most. They led by example, by fear and by wielding power that both terrified and awed their brethren. Once the Romans invaded the Kingdom of the Nile, however, the Bak-Ra found themselves being hunted down and persecuted for heresy and other crimes against the “one true God.” Many of the Bak-Ra decided to enter voluntary torpor as a means of escaping the insidious traps of the Roman Kindred, hoping to keep Ra’s greatest, most powerful secrets away from the mongrel Ventrue of Rome and their vampire puppets.\n\nUnfortunately for the Bak-Ra, they were forgotten, left buried in their tombs for an unfathomable three thousand years, unable to awaken themselves, consumed by madness and trapped in the fog of time. Now, they have an unquenchable thirst for everything that was taken from them. For the Bak-Ra of modern nights, their only hope is to rediscover their history and locate the rituals, tools and abilities that made them what they once were. They are in a desperate search for their identity and clues to their place in modern nights.\n\nNow, an irresistible drive to remember who they were, and what they were once capable of, fills their blood with renewed purpose and vitality. The Bak-Ra who have awakened in the modern nights have become obsessive scholars, doing everything in their power to relearn their history. Sadly, those who have managed to crawl up from their earthen tombs find that they are often the targets of scorn, ridicule and mockery. This only fuels their insane fervor more, feeding their Beast for the night that they can unleash it and exact their revenge.\n\nFinally, it is important to note that all the Bak-Ra know about their past is what is available to the historians of the modern nights, along with the few fragments that individual Bak-Ra kept in their tombs. No known member of this bloodline has awakened with her memories intact.\n\n**Nickname:** Servants of Ra, Childer of the Sun, The Sun-Stroked (derogatory)\n\n**History and Culture:** It seems odd that a clan most noted for its aversion to the sun and affinity towards shadows should, in fact, not only worship the god of the sun, but claim to have once been able to walk beneath it as easily as any human. The power of Ra, however, remains within their collective souls. They fervently, obsessively, believe that they were once able to walk during the day, beneath the Sun, and they know for certain that it is only a matter of time before they remember how to do so again.\n\nPerhaps the secrets are still hidden in one of their buried tombs. Perhaps one of their allies, the Usiri, has their secrets and memories stored in dream-space somewhere. Whatever the case, the Bak-Ra are intent on rediscovering their past glory. In the meantime, they endure the ridicule and spend much of their time in self-imposed exile, studying and waiting for the night when they can make the heretic invaders suffer for their transgressions.\n\nWhat the Childer of the Sun know in their undead hearts is that Ra ruled the heavens and thus, it is only logical that his followers ruled the Earth. However, history tells them that Ra’s priests didn’t rule unilaterally, but rather that the Cult of Ra merely managed an already unified covenant of gods. Rather than provide comfort however, this information merely angers and confuses them. How could such disparate beliefs ever come to a consensus and unity? Why would Ra deign to share power with lesser beings?\n\nAnd yet, every historical artifact discovered and every piece of information received leads the Bak-Ra to the realization that this was, indeed, the case. The possibility that their history is a lie, a fiction written by the murderous, invading Ventrue dogs of Rome, flames their already virulent distrust and hatred of the Lords. There can be, in their minds, no other plausible explanation for what has happened to them. Why hadn’t the others awakened them sooner? Where were the Anubi, the Usiri, the Hori or the Thothites? Why hadn’t they come?\n\nThe one thing that *all* Bak-Ra retain is their physical ties to ancient Egypt. They often appear in colorful, flowing gowns which are always adorned with scarabs and symbols of Ra somewhere on their person. Their havens display Egyptian artifacts as if they were artwork. Indeed, the Bak-Ra can often be seen creating new papyrus in the ancient style, perhaps as a way of relearning their culture. Whenever entertaining a perspective client, it is always remarked, later, that the look in the Bak-Ra’s eyes is one of joyous expectation, as if they know it is only a matter of time before the lesser “covenants” look up to them once again, begging them for Ra’s mercy and trembling in fear of the Sun God’s wrath.\n\nThe Servants of Ra disappeared from history and those who have been awakened do not like what they are learning of the past three thousand years. They harbor grudges against their former allies, the Usiri, the Anubi and the other cults of Egypt that still exist. They shudder at the thought that Ventrue hold so much power and that the gods are nothing but myths, parables and fables. This Lancea Sanctum troubles them, as does the Ordo Dracul and its progenitor. The Carthians make no sense to the Bak-Ra, for what is an existence without the gods to offer strength and guidance? Only the Circle of the Crone and the Agoniste bloodline offer them hope that they might regain some of their lost knowledge. Unfortunately, the Circle’s history is almost as muddled as their own and the Agonistes are unable to provide the Bak-Ra with what they really need.\n\n> **A Terrifiying New World**  \n>  Recently, a Sanctified coterie, searching for relics beneath one of the great pyramids of Giza, located a well-hidden entrance beneath the deepest of the known archeological digs. This opening dropped the coterie deeper into the Earth and fed into a trap-laden network of caves and crawlspaces. The coterie lost two of its members in the exploration, which eventually ended in the tomb of an ancient Kindred, still in torpor. The remaining vampires decided to awaken the sleeping vampire, curious as to what it was and, hopefully, prepared for what they would learn. He rose from his sleep enraged, claiming to be something called a Bak-Ra. He began screaming incoherently, and the coterie believed that he had been driven insane by the amount of time spent in torpor. The coterie quickly subdued the Bak-Ra and realized that they had discovered an ancient vampire who might offer them power beyond their imagination. They returned to the surface with their find and showed the ancient vampire what he had awakened to, hoping that he would understand the futility of his situation and go with them for further study and indoctrination into this terrifying new world he had been awakened into. The shock of seeing such dramatic change was enough to shatter what was left of his precarious sanity. He escaped the coterie and fled back into the depths of the Egyptian sands. The coterie attempted to track him, but lost the ancient in the tunnels. They left before sunrise and when they returned the next evening, they discovered that the entire network of tunnels beneath the pyramids had collapsed. Their prize was gone, and with him whatever secrets he may have held in his withered brain.\n\n**Reputation:** The Bak-Ra are considered eccentric and excitable misfits. They have a reputation among Kindred of the modern nights as neonates with delusions of grandeur, sad little sun worshippers who can never get what they want. The Sun-Stroked hide in their shadowy lairs, wear their fancy robes, talk to their beetles and whisper to themselves in harsh, guttural curses. Especially among the Invictus, they are considered useless.\n\nDerogatory nicknames notwithstanding, the Bak-Ra are absolutely certain that they were once able to walk in sunlight without fear of the curse burning them to ash. They are convinced that all they need to do is rediscover the secrets that time has stolen from them. Those secrets are surely hidden somewhere inside their minds or beneath the desert sands and it is only a matter of time until they are found.\n\nFrom a practical standpoint, it is impossible to argue with a Bak-Ra regarding her beliefs. The total conviction each member of this bloodline possesses seems to be hard-wired into their blood and that kind of religious zeal is difficult to refute.\n\nThey say that history will prove that their claims are not just lies and madness. When they discover the truth, and they will discover the truth, the Servants of Ra will remember those who helped them. And they will *especially* remember those who stood in their way.\n\n> **The Bak-Ra and the Agonistes**  \n>  The Agonistes are a bloodline devoted to uncovering the truths of Kindred history and spreading that truth to every covenant and individual vampire they can. Unfortunately, the Bak-Ra have no memory of their past. This severely limits their uses to the Agonistes.\n> \n> The Bak-Ra have been reduced to begging the Agonistes for the use of their libraries in order to gather more information about themselves. They promise to share with them everything that they discover. However, there is no guarantee that the Bak-Ra will ever learn anything about their past, although the Servants will never admit that as a possibility. Thus, they spend much of their time questioning the Agonistes, whose information of Kindred history prior to the fall of Rome is incomplete at best. The Bak-Ra hope that the Agonistes will provide something that may spark a fog-enshrouded memory to surface, or show the path to discovering where those bits of history might be.\n\n**Concepts:** Psychology student, eccentric collector, self-help guru, political advisor, ancient history professor, Kindred sociologist, astronomer, Agoniste stalker, occult preacher, Harpy', 'Forgotten, scorned and fervent', 4, 167, 3, NULL, 'MekhetBakRa-63acc36f5f268.webp', 'Servants of Ra, Childer of the Sun, Sun-Stroked', '<p>The Bak-Ra have the Mekhet clan weakness (see p. 109 of <strong>Vampire: The Requiem</strong>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, the Bak-Ra, as devoted (some would say fanatical) sun-worshippers, have difficulty leaving the sunlit world behind and joining the dark Requiem every night.

They seek to do and see everything under the sun, and to one day, all else in their lives completed, walk under it one final time.', 'The Erzsébet long to walk in the light. Not to commit suicide. Not to be mortal again. The Erzsébet exalt in their undeath, singing Requiems that might be hymns of praise. They long to walk in the sun because it’s the only thing they haven’t done yet. Members of the Erzsébet know that, while eternity is within their reach, it cannot go uninterrupted. As age creeps in and poisons their blood, they are reminded that nothing can stave off torpor forever. They enjoy their unlives to the fullest, so that they may sail into the ages without regret.\n\n**Nickname:** Cavaliers (contemporary), the Withered (derogatory). They also go by many family names, including Moretti, Syska and Rózsa.\n\n**History and Culture:** The Erzsébet have very little history as a bloodline, but quite a bit as immediate families and individuals. They owe this to the peculiar circumstances of their line’s recorded appearances in Europe. In the late 17th century, a woman calling herself Syska appeared at several courts in northern Italy.\n\nTravel in the Mediterranean region was unusually easy in that period, thanks to many active trade routes and Kindred financing thereof. The Mediterranean Kindred were undergoing something of a Renaissance of their own, reveling in widespread cooperation between independent Ventrue rulers; at the time, the Ventrue were popularly aligning themselves as the founders of the Invictus and the truest heirs to Rome. At the same time, the Lancea Sanctum was enjoying a spiritual resurgence led by glorious churches and the revival of pilgrimages. These traditions were bolstered by the availability of skilled mortal labor-for-hire and the awakening of large numbers of crusader Kindred.\n\nCooperation between Princes was common, if always from a distance, and Syska made herself useful as a messenger. Due to her varying age and long disappearances, she was widely believed to be a brood of several different Daeva, perhaps Embraced from the same mortal stock. In fact, Syska was a single vampire, afflicted with the aging common to her bloodline. Syska is the earliest known Erzsébet, and was believed to be Polish by the Kindred she dealt with in Italy. Later claims that either her mortal or vampiric line were Hungarian are difficult to verify. In 1657, Syska appeared before the Court of Milan for the last time. She became embroiled in an argument over whether she had been using her nomadic existence to Embrace promiscuously, and murdered her accuser. She was sentenced to torpor, but escaped.\n\nIn 1751, a young-looking elder named Rózsa appeared in Vienna. Recently-published histories had made a folk-heroine out of Elizabeth Bathory, the so-called Blood Countess. While mortal culture wouldn’t identify Bathory with vampirism for several centuries, the Kindred of Vienna celebrated the murderess almost as one of their own. The myth of a mortal who understood why life must be stolen gripped the Kindred imagination in Vienna. Parties were held reenacting and exaggerating Lady Bathory’s crimes. The sins of the mortal became heroism to the damned. The Kindred have often indulged excess, and the growing Bathory legends provided a theme for this prediliction, connecting it to the humanity that the stuffy Lancea Sanctum urged secular vampires to abandon.\n\nRózsa emerged into this social scene claiming not only to be Hungarian... but to be the childe of Elizabeth Bathory herself! Her stories were met both with applause (for their daring) and skepticism (for their general implausibility). Rózsa built a cult of personality around her mother and herself. She claimed that, like Dracula, Elizabeth Bathory had been cursed by God, and that her alleged death was only torpor, the result of being deprived of the blood she required. Bathory, said Rózsa, had been buried in unmarked and unhallowed ground, her monument inscribed with a false name.\n\nRózsa threw herself into the parties and asked for nothing but invitations... yet, sometimes she lamented that her fortunes had declined, that she could not return to her mother’s tomb and raise the Blood Countess from the dead. She began to age, gradually, lending more credence to her claim that her unique line suffered a unique curse. Bathing in blood, she said, was her mother’s means of comfort, not a true ward against the curse’s power. Other Kindred gave her small sums of money, fortunes that might enable her to locate her mother’s resting place and wake the heroine, and Rózsa cached them throughout the region. When it became clear that she had no intent to mount the search or even return to Hungary, Rózsa and her childe fled Vienna  \n for the shores of England, where she reinvented herself as one Mariza Moretti.\n\nAuctors and other nomadic mercenaries were dispatched to follow her. Over time, small donations had become large fortunes, and the Kindred of Vienna wanted them back. They offered substantial rewards for the capture of any “Erzsébet,” rewards worth risking the roads and sun for. Mariza became Marisa, and spawned several broods, at least one of which came with her when she relocated to the Americas.\n\nTonight, the American Erzsébet are largely known as the Moretti. They generally present themselves as a line of Daeva with a unique and unexplained curse. The Erzsébet understand their aging as a growing poison in the Blood, and often believe it as a consequence of growing in potency rather than age. Some modern cousins of the bloodline refer to it as if it were a virus somehow unique to vampires within their family. Nonetheless, most know that it cannot be transmitted. Some have tried to cure it by making pacts with spirits. Others join the Order of the Dragon and perform obscene experiments upon themselves. A few even approach mortal doctors, wondering if the problem is a conflict between humanity and undeath rather than a true weakness in their Vitae.\n\nErzsébet often feel more kinship with their ghouls than Kindred outside their bloodline, and certainly more than those out- side their clan. Ghouls, too, are afforded an altered mortality instead of true agelessness. Where they can suppress passion and impatience, they often groom ghouls over decades to prime them as new members of the family. When Marisa herself traveled to the New World, as many of her brood were ghouls as were childer. Even before the modern day, Erzsébet tended to keep in touch with her progeny. A few hunters still chase them on behalf of European Kindred.\n\nMost Erzsébet qualify for the Close Family Merit, and several have independently invented the Night Life Devotion. Their Auspex enables them to avoid the bounty hunters who still occasionally pursue them, and to enjoy every pleasure of unlife just a little more.

They have a human side that shan’t be repressed.\n\nSome might say, though, that they get it wrong. They equate “humanity” not with a spiritual quality but instead associate with human society: the acquisition of assets (money, property, items of status), the attendance of mortal events (dinners, dances, parties, balls), the mimicry of all things human (emotion, relationships, manners, body language, slang).

Wycombe, a Nosferatu, was one of the few vampric members of a local hellfire club called “the Abbey.” He helped supply these taboo-smashing humans secure “assets” for their little soirees and “erotic gardens.” He brought them other vampires. The humans feasted and fucked. They used the captive Damned as toys and toilet paper, teaching the monsters that they did not know what it meant to be a monster. Wycombe did not involve himself in such activity except when it pleased him: he did it for money, and to destroy his enemies, not for any perverse thrill.\n\nThen came the night that Wycombe came to realize what he had done, what he had become. Why the revelation, few know. He won’t say (and Wycombe is still out there, make no mistake of that). Some whisper he saw an angel. Other stranger stories tell of a night where Wycombe sat at a nook table across from his Beast. They supped cups of blood. And the Beast tried to get him to sell his soul to, well, the Devil. Wycombe apparently refused and resolved to put himself on a path to... not righteousness, not really, but a path to humanity.\n\nIt didn’t work as perfectly as he had planned, though he and most members of the Cockscomb Society seem oblivious to that fact. First, their mimicry of humanity is not actually an embrace of the human experience, it’s a hollow quest to appear human. Second, Wycombe’s origins in the hellfire club seem to haunt his brood: as noted, they cannot help but give in to languor, answering boredom with sin. Secret sin, of course: they do not publicize their deviations. That could ruin them.\n\n**Reputation:** Honestly, they have a pretty good reputation. Yes, they’re Nosferatu, but they seemed so well-mannered, so clean, so articulate. They aren’t brutes and oddities, not for the most part. Nicely tamed, they talk the talk, walk the walk. That doesn’t stop the sinister whispers, but few believe them. Stories of the Cockscomb Gents and Gals out there given over to potent ennui and thus giving in to great debauchery... well, it can’t be true, can it? All that blood and nudity? The gorging and regurgitating? The gross usury and rampant avarice? They seem so refined for Nosferatu. It’s probably just rumor.', 'Human, dull', 34, 106, 4, NULL, 'NosferatuCockscombSociety-63e58208cee50.webp', 'Gents, Gals', '<p>They try to be human. They really do. Problem is, clinging to human ways is a false face for many, and worse, it gets just a tiny bit dull.

(34, 'Lygos', 'Obsessed with the darkness that hides their features, the Lygos worship the absence of light as if it were a divinity.', 'Light is noise. Darkness is the absence of that noise.\n\nAt least, that’s how the Nosferatu of the Lygos lineage see it. To them, the darkness is pure. It envelops them. For lack of a better term, it embraces them. They are the pillbugs and maggots underneath a darkened log. They are ribbons of shadow deeper than the shades of night itself. Light is garish. It does not reveal: it only confuses. When light shines upon a vampire of the Lygos, he hisses and spits and retreats from the luminous intrusion.\n\nThat part isn’t all that hard to understand, really. The Nosferatu are aberrant either physically or spiritually (for some, it’s both), and the darkness is a place of hiding, of safety, and of advantage. Plus, they’re vampires. Light is anathema to all the Damned, at least to a degree.\n\nBut the Lygos? They worship the darkness. It is a living thing, to them. It has no name, and it has no face (for darkness is all-consuming, and one could not see its face regardless), but it is a real thing, an encompassing entity deserving of veneration. A Nosferatu of the Lygos whispers prayers and entreaties to the darkness to keep them safe if not sane. He begs the darkness to swallow his enemies. He might even leave little treats and baubles behind as gifts for the shadows, and none are surprised when those trifles go missing by moonrise the next night.\n\n> **Cronies?**  \n>  It might seem natural for these Nosferatu to belong to the Circle of the Crone, and this is true for some. But to most, the darkness is well-beyond the bloody fundamentals espoused by the cults of the Crone. Darkness predates everything. Before the world was drawn up out of beautiful chaos, there lingered only impenetrable darkness—the Crone might be a granddaughter of that darkness, but that doesn’t automatically make her the deified matron of the Lygos.\n\n**History and Culture:** The Lygos won’t admit to this story, not ever. And it might not even be true (even though they fear that it is): once in the lands of Egypt there lurked a powerful Mekhet known as Nebt-Het Asenath. Asenath was said to be a childe of Longinus, the Dark Father, and was rebelling against him and hoping to stir awake old gods who might come to spite her sire. And so she walked to Ethiopia where there waited an old church buried beneath the ground, covered up because it had been made home to fallen gods, the Lord’s touch erased from the stone. In uncovering the church she discovered a nest of torpid vampires: wretched, pale Nosferatu who had dwelled too long in the dark. They awoke when she troubled their grave, and they swarmed her. It is said that it wasn’t one who performed the diablerie, but all of them together in grim simultaneity. In consuming the Vitae and soul of this potent Shadow, this clutch of Worms suffered what some say was a terrible corruption and what others (those of the bloodline) claim to have been a powerful revelation. They became the Lygos, servants of the darkness, adherents of shadow.\n\nFor the most part, the Lygos in modern nights stay far the hell away from the tempests and incests of the Damned, preferring instead to remain in the darkest places the city presents, a hissing nest of monsters. They usually do “elect” a representative, though, a bridge between the world of the rest of the Damned and the darkness of the Lygos. This go-between communes with both sides, and ushers favors and requests where appropriate.', 'Darkness worshiper', 34, 107, 4, NULL, 'NosferatuLygos-63e5839267f7a.webp', 'Creeps, Shades', '<p>The light really fucks with a Lygos&rsquo; senses.

Curiously, this penalty applies to all Perception rolls, even those that don&rsquo;t involve sight.

(35, 'Mnemosyne', 'A bloodline with power over memory, they possess knowledge that is the envy of all Kindred -- knowledge which drives many Mnemosyne elders mad.', 'Blood is more than the life. Blood is heredity; blood is memory; blood is instinct. The Mnemosyne don’t just know this for a fact: they are the fact. Everything they do is tied to the concept of memory. The Kindred are terrified of losing their past. They sleep and fall prey to terrible dreams; they wake and begin to wonder which was the dream and which was reality. History plays tricks on the Kindred. You sleep for a century, and when you wake up, you barely know who you are. Dreams of making love and dreams of drinking the blood of kings; dreams of flying, dreams of devils with the faces of owls, dreams of people who you never met and people who have yet to be born. You wake up; the world has changed. You doubt everything you were before. Each slumber makes you a little less human, a little more dead.\n\nAnd yet, the Mnemosyne don’t seem to have that problem. There aren’t so many of them. Their power is simple, potent: they feed on memories.\n\nA Mnemosyne uncovers the truth, shares it, buries it and keeps it secret. The dead value the Mnemosyne for that reason; there are none more efficient at manipulating history. In the hands of a Mnemosyne, history doesn’t stand a chance.\n\n**History and Culture:** Ironically, no one remembers where the Mnemosyne came from. They were there in Rome – a second-century CE testament belonging to the Cult of Augurs, a branch of the Roman Camarilla who dealt with prophecy and magic, grants privileges to the childer of a vampire belonging to the “Mnemosynidae” along one stretch of the Tiber. So, clearly, they must have existed long enough to have become a family before that. Documents since that time are rare. Old Kindred say they were always there, or always talked about if they weren’t present. But they weren’t ever the movers and shakers. They  \n just existed in the dark, hiding, emerging sometimes to save an elder’s sanity, or drive another elder insane.\n\nThat’s the most anyone can work out. The Mnemosyne don’t keep their own histories; they’re too busy playing with the pasts of others. Broods of them exist, small families who settle in areas and absorb the local culture. Some vampires, who make studies of such things, identify them with the long-dead Moirai. But the Moirai are gone now (aren’t they?), while the Mnemosyne are clearly here.\n\nThe memories they absorb, exchange and alter do strange things to a vampire’s mind. The older Mnemosyne don’t have names anymore. They’re detached, prone to amnesia and madness. Here’s a Keeper who is nearly blank, a cipher without a true identity of his own, having washed away the memories of so many others that his own have become lost. Here’s another who is so full of other people’s memories that she has become taken within the whirl of experiences and personalities. Ireneo Funes, Prince of Buenos Aires, is rumored to be such a Mnemosyne, a creature who long ago lost his individuality, who eats the mind and memory of every victim he feeds upon, gaining a new splinter of personality each day.\n\nA pair of Mnemosyne who were twins in life swap memories (and hence personalities) so often that they become interchangeable. They talk sometimes in unison. They finish one another’s sentences. They answer to either name. They can’t even tell themselves apart anymore.\n\nWhile more Mnemosyne are unaligned than belong to Covenants, virtually all of them have duties within the hierarchies of their home towns, and those who don’t have some sort of fixed post sell their services to the highest bidder.\n\nNiall works as a Hound for his Prince. Unlike more direct Hounds, he’s something of a detective, a methodical worker. He sifts evidence, reads minds. He finds truths. An older Mnemosyne works as more of a psychic surgeon, a detective who heals the memory of his aged prince each time he falls into torpor. A Mnemosyne in one of the larger cities serves as a cleaner of sorts, one who wipes breaches of the Masquerade from the minds of mortals and incriminating information from the memories of ghouls and Kindred.\n\n**Reputation:** The Mnemosyne are, perhaps inevitably, better known by reputation than by acquaintance. The stories are many and fearsome, and Mnemosyne often find that other vampires have made up their minds before ever meeting them.\n\nCovenants and Clans are ambivalent about the Mnemosyne. They fear them. If they can really steal memories, they say, they can take their own. But at the same time, they find lost memories. They share them. Each of the five great Covenants respects that. The Invictus and Sanctified alike value those who can verify chronicles and genealogies. The Acolytes and Ordo Dracul may take very different approaches to the question, but both Covenants react with curiosity to a vampire who can drink memories through blood. And while the Carthians may care less for history, the conspirators who maneuver their Covenant towards what they see as inevitable control can find uses for a drinker of memories and a thief of minds.\n\nA Mnemosyne who appears in a city, then, may well be showered with offers of patronage and employment from every quarter; but he should beware, for taking sides makes enemies, and refusing to take sides makes more. Often, the choice is between which enemies to make.', 'Knowledgable, mad', 61, 82, 3, NULL, 'MekhetMnemosyne-63e62905bf9d1.webp', 'Keepers', '<p>The Mnemosyne have their clan weakness also.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the unique power of a Mnemosyne depends upon drinking Vitae, it has the side effect of making the Keeper crave it.

(36, 'Norvegi', 'A scorned bloodline that lacks fangs, they none the less have the power to manipulate flesh, bone, and Vitae, warping it to their command.', 'Some bloodlines are a matter of honor; others are a matter of shame. Outsiders who know of the Norvegi think them a reproach upon the Kindred, a deformity. The elders of some of the covenants permit them to endure, and if they grudgingly admit the efficiency with which they make other Kindred vanish and clear up messes, they cannot accept the “Norwegian bloodline” as whole Kindred. For they have no fangs. They seem to have no problem finding blood and rarely leave a mess. But if no one pays attention to this strange efficiency, it’s because they think the Norvegi to be beneath their notice.\n\nAmong elders of the five great Covenants, it’s received wisdom that a Norvegus or Norvega is a waste of dead flesh, and so prevalent is this idea that few of those wise, far-seeing elders ask if that’s the case; they don’t question why the bloodline is still thriving, more numerous in this over-populated age than it has ever been. The dead have always struggled among themselves for resources – surely, weaklings like the Norvegi would have died out long ago?\n\nThe fact is, they’ve found a niche. They do dirty jobs, cheaply and efficiently. Why should an elder ask how all the blood gets so efficiently cleaned away, or how brutally his enemy was dismembered? His only interest lies in the act itself.\n\nAnd this is their second secret: they may be devoid of fangs, but they have other means of gaining blood. Long ago, they found the secret of warping Vitae and bone. They have the ability to grow, instantly and silently, hollow spikes and plates of blood and bone from their very flesh, extending and withdrawing them at will, if only they have the Vitae to spare.\n\nA vampire who underestimates a Norvega finds a pointing fingertip extending in a split-second into a long spike that skewers his eyeball and enters his forebrain. Another turns his back to see a blood-and-bone blade extending through his body. Another thinks he’s got the Norvega assassin sent to destroy him cornered, only to find her transformed into a bristling, thorn-bedecked monster.\n\nThe Norvegi, by tradition, keep their trump card hidden. One of the Kindred who sees a Norvegus using his power is likely to be either trusted entirely, or about to be dead forever. They bide their time and strike unexpectedly. They know that other vampires are faster and stronger, and prefer to use their powers of clairvoyance to gain an advantage. The Norvegi allow themselves to be underestimated, knowing that in being beneath notice comes safety, of a sort.\n\n**Nickname:** “Knives” among themselves; to elders “the Norwegian bloodline,” and to other outsiders “Scum,” “Filth,” and things less printable.\n\n**History and Culture:** Sometime in the Middle Ages, the idea arose among the Kindred of Europe that the vampires of the North, members of the alleged Clan Grettir, were in-bred. Tales circulated of a web of Vinculi, and that a tradition of cross-generational diablerie and a dependence on ghouls had weakened them. Although they drank the vibrant blood of the Norse peoples of the age, and brought their own living family members into the fold after death, their deficient blood had taken away their fangs.\n\nAmong the bloodlines of the North, they were outcast. They carved out a niche as criminals among the dead. They were killers and thieves. The Renaissance came, and the Age of Reason followed, and the Norvegi gradually spread south, receiving the same prejudice and taking the same jobs, and so it is tonight. Many domains across Britain, Germany, the Baltic states, the former USSR and the northern parts of North America have small families of Norvegi. The members of the bloodline manipulate their living families, and at least one ghoul family depends upon Norvegi blood. Many Norvegi make their havens with their living (ghoul) families, and more than half of the Norvegi active in Europe and North America tonight were their sires’ ghouls before they were Embraced, enslaved by the bonds of Vinculi long before they died. And yet, the relationship between sire and childe is not so simple; the tradition of the Norvegi has it that the Elder of the Norvegi allow themselves to be diablerized – painfully, messily – by their childer before old age forces them into torpor, presumably so that their memories remain, rather than be washed away by the Fog of Ages.\n\nA Norvega named Astrid served until recently as the secret assassin of the Lady of London, not caring that the Lady will not acknowledge her publicly, but glad to be left alone when not working. Her disappearance went largely unnoticed. An old, powerful Norvegus operates in the New York Subway system as a kind of unofficial marshal. He preys upon and protects the homeless at the same time, as if farming them for his own personal use. Thanks to his vile-smelling ghouls, he knows everything that goes on underground within a matter of hours, or sometimes minutes. A pair of Norvegi in Anchorage, banned from Kindred society for simply being “less than vampires,” has been taking down the Prince’s brood one by one.\n\n**Reputation:** This is the paradox of the Norvegi’s reputation: the Covenants find them beneath their notice, and yet they consider the Norvegi the vampires to hire when something needs to be stolen or someone must be killed forever. The Norvega names her price, freely, and if the paymaster refuses to haggle, she shrugs and walks away. She is not worth talking to and is thrust to the margins of the Kindred night-society, and yet her discretion is expected and her ability to do the job is not in question.\n\nThe Kindred know that the Norvegi keep whole stables of ghouls, but leave them to it. The Invictus and the Acolytes will tell you that they’re no threat, that they’re not worth bothering with. The Ordo Dracul don’t even consider them to be Kindred, imagining them to be some sort of mutant sub-vampire and regarding them with mild curiosity before moving on to some more interesting topic of study. The Carthians, who bother, say that they’re not really the proletariat of the Kindred, but some other, less developed group, less suited for revolution. And the Lancea Sanctum consider them damned and immaterial. Sure, a Norvegus can join, but he won’t rise very far before prejudice rears its head.', 'Scum, unfanged', 61, 84, 3, NULL, 'MekhetNorvegi-63e640e66d2eb.webp', 'Knives', '<p>A Norvegus suffers from one of the weaknesses of his parent clan, but humiliatingly, he has no fangs. He must either drink blood through having shed it with a blade (although, as a Norvegus, he is rarely without a blade), and cannot administer the Kiss, meaning that aware victims always put up a fight. This is the same as the Flaw: No Fangs (p. 118). Childer of the Norvegi, who have not yet fully developed the bloodline, usually have this Flaw. Any character who has the Flaw: No Fangs and who joins the bloodline ceases to gain experience point bonuses gained from the Flaw as soon as he joins the bloodline, because it becomes in game terms a bloodline weakness rather than a Flaw.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, because of the historical prejudice against the Norvegi, no Norvegus or Norvega can ever gain more than two dots of Status in any Covenant.</p>', 'Yes.

(1, 'clan', 'Each Kindred is a member of a clan. A clan is a group of vampires who all share common characteristics. Popular Kindred mythology suggests that all vampires are assumed to have descended from one common Kindred, the founder of that clan, though no one knows who those founders might be. When a vampire Embraces a new Kindred, the progeny is of the same clan as the progenitor. Certain “sub-clans” of vampires also exist, known as bloodlines, but a vampire can never change her clan.\r\n\r\nA clan is a vampiric lineage. The Kindred acknowledge five clans, and all Kindred belong to one clan or another. The most widely accepted theory regarding clans is that they are like “families” of vampires. Members of clans all inherit certain mystical commonalities, from acumen with certain Disciplines to traditional shortcomings for their particular type. One of the failings of the “families” theory is that none of the clan progenitors are reliably known, and only a few are guessed at with any degree of confidence. Certainly, the clans came from somewhere — but where? In a modern context, only two Kindred are known to have no clan, and they haven’t reliably demonstrated that they’ve been able to Embrace over the course of their Requiems. These vampires, the legendary Dracula and the Roman centurion Longinus are responsible for the creation of certain covenants, not clans, but might they be on a path toward clan creation themselves? And if the origin of clans doesn’t lie with certain progenitor vampires, from what source do clans originate? If Longinus and Dracula have no clan, who’s to say that other, more secretive Kindred haven’t also suffered the curse in the same way?\r\n\r\nTonight, the influence of the clans is felt almost everywhere. The five clans have a presence throughout the Western world, or so it is believed. The Kindred definitely came to the New World along with the early colonists, suggesting that these vampires are European in origin, or that they grew out of the civilizations that first populated the world and followed the movements of mortal men. Oral histories and sparse records indicate that some vampiric presence existed among the tribal cultures of North America before its colonization, but whether these creatures were members of clans or solitary, unique beings — or even if they were truly vampires at all — cannot be determined. While information on the Far East is fleeting, members of the five clans are known to be active there, as they are in Africa, South America and much of the Middle East. Still, little is known about how indigenous culture shapes the understanding of clans in all these regions, and anyone attempting to study the phenomenon is probably wise to take no presuppositions with him.\r\n\r\nA bloodline is like a clan, but its characteristics are not so universal. It might help to think of a bloodline as a “sub-clan.” Not all vampires are members of bloodlines. Each bloodline has a parent clan from which it distinctly diverges, yet claims descent. Kindred scholars have no reliable estimates of how many bloodlines exist in the world tonight, because bloodlines can arise at any time and few of them would stand up to be counted, even if some formal roster of them were made.\r\n'),

They’re purchased during character creation or with experience points over the course of your chronicle.\r\n\r\nThe Merits in this chapter are organized alphabetically into three broad categories: Physical, Mental and Social. Some apply to your character’s basic traits to enhance them in particular situations. Some have prerequisites that must be met before they can be purchased. For example, a character with the Gunslinger Merit must have a Dexterity of 3 and Firearms of 3 or higher to be able to accurately fire two weapons at the same time. By the same token, some Merits apply drawbacks that balance out their inherent advantages. A character with the Fame Merit, for example, is treated like a star wherever he goes — but has a hard time blending into the crowd when he wants to.\r\n\r\nEach Merit has a number of dots (•) associated with it. These dots represent the number of points that must be spent to purchase the Merit. Some Merits allow for a range of dots (say, • to •••). These allow you to purchase a low rating if it’s appropriate to your character concept, or you can start with a low level and increase it over time with experience points.\r\n\r\nA character is born with some Merits or develops them early in life, while others can be acquired through trail and error, training and effort later in life.\r\n\r\nThe first kind can be acquired at character creation only and are labeled as such. The second kind can be acquired during play with experience points.\r\n\r\nMerit dots must be purchased sequentially with experience points. You have to buy • and then •• before your character can have ••• or more.'),
(3, 'attribute', 'People have the inherent capacity to act, behave and think. We can perform actions and have intuitive talents such as running, theorizing and persuading others. So does your character. His basic, fundamental capabilities are represented with Attributes, which are the foundation of all the acts that he performs. These traits are classified into three categories — Mental, Physical and Social — and are rolled to determine how well your character accomplishes efforts in the game.\r\n\r\nMental Attributes suggest how insightful, clever and determined your character is. They are Intelligence, Wits and Resolve.\r\nPhysical Attributes indicate how strong, graceful and enduring your character is. They are Strength, Dexterity and Stamina. \r\nSocial Attributes determine how imposing, magnetic and dignified your character is. They are Presence, Manipulation and Composure.\r\nThe Attributes of ordinary people are rated from 1 to 5. It’s possible for someone to have more dots, but these individuals are typically beyond the human ken, partially or fully a part of the mysterious supernatural world. Perhaps they’re touched by spirits or born to a legacy of service to unseen beings.\r\n\r\nYour character, even as a mortal human, automatically starts with one dot in each Attribute. These dots are already filled in on your character sheet. When your character performs an action, the Attribute most appropriate to the effort is referenced. If he tries to remember what he read during library research last week, you look to his Intelligence dots. If he tries to jump a chasm, you check his Strength. If he tries to make a good first impression on a group of people, you apply his Presence score.\r\n\r\nYour character’s dots are usually rolled as part of a dice pool. Attributes are sometimes combined and rolled to see if an action can be accomplished, but they are more often combined with Skills. The Storyteller will tell you what Attributes are applicable to your character’s actions, and what rolls you can make. In general, the three classes of Attributes are used based on the circumstances. One of each of the Mental, Physical and Social traits has bearing on a different kind of action, as outlined in the boxed text.\r\n\r\n**Power** is the degree of effect that your character has on others and his surroundings. The higher his score, the smarter, more potent or more imposing he is. Intelligence, Strength and Presence therefore apply when your character seeks to force himself on his environment.\r\n\r\n**Finesse** is a measure of your character’s capacity to interact with the world and influence others. The higher his score, the craftier, more delicate and more influential he is. Wits, Dexterity and Manipulation have bearing when your character tries to anticipate and react to his environment, and to coordinate others.\r\n\r\n**Resistance** indicates how well your character copes with influences from both without and within that might affect him adversely. The higher his score the more staunch, sturdy or dignified he is. Resolve, Stamina and Composure apply when your character responds to coercion, injury and influence. Resolve tests his ability to resist efforts to direct his mind, Stamina helps him shrug off physical trauma, and Composure helps him recover from horrifying experiences or social tension and still maintain control.\r\n\r\nThus, you don’t usually check Strength when your character is challenged in a social situation, because brute force doesn’t apply where Composure (social recovery) is concerned. Similarly, Dexterity doesn’t typically have bearing when interpreting a foreign language. That act calls upon the power of the mind and is the purview of Intelligence.\r\n\r\n\r\n> **Attribute Dots**\r\n>\r\n> Attributes are rated 1 to 5 for ordinary people, and each score suggests the degree of your character’s raw capability in that area.\r\n>\r\n> **Dots Talent**\r\n>\r\n> • Poor. Unexercised, unpracticed or inept.\r\n>\r\n> •• Average. The result of occasional effort or application.\r\n>\r\n> ••• Good. Regular practice or effort, or naturally talented.\r\n>\r\n> •••• Exceptional. Frequently applied, tested and honed, or naturally gifted.\r\n>\r\n> ••••• Outstanding. The peak of normal human capability. Continuously exercised or naturally blessed.\r\n>\r\n> Normally, it’s not possible for a character to have zero dots in an Attribute. That suggests the absolute vacancy of any capability in the trait in question. Now, a person could be physically, mentally or socially disabled or crippled. Those conditions are reflected with Flaws (see p. 217), however, not through zero-rated Attributes.\r\n>\r\n>Just about the only instance in which an Attribute can be reduced to zero (and usually temporarily) is by supernatural means. A spell, curse or affliction is imposed on your character that eliminates all of the dots in his trait. In these cases, no roll can be made at all whenever the Attribute in question would normally be called for. So, if your character is afflicted with total loss of bodily control (zero Dexterity), you make no rolls for any situation that calls for Dexterity in a dice pool, even if he has dots in a pertinent Skill or has access to tools that would be helpful. Your character can’t even hope to aim a gun or direct his movements. In essence, the action fails outright.\r\n\r\nWhen creating your character, you must prioritize his capability with the Attribute categories. His Mental, Physical and Social traits must be given primary, secondary and tertiary emphasis. If you want your character to be active and hardy, Physical traits might be primary. If his ability to react to and deal with people is nearly but not quite as important, Social Attributes could be secondary. That leaves Mental traits as tertiary. He’s not the sharpest tack in the box, or life just hasn’t demanded that he exercise his cognitive potential.\r\n\r\nYou get to allocate five dots among your character’s primary Attributes. You assign four dots among his secondary Attributes. And you get three dots to divvy up among his tertiary traits. The dots available to each category can be distributed among its three Attributes as evenly or unevenly as you like. So, you might decide to apply three dots to your character’s Strength, one to his Dexterity and one to his Stamina. That’s all five of his primary class allocated. Two of your four Social dots might go to each of Manipulation and Composure. And, you might assign one of each of your three Mental dots to Intelligence, Wits and Resolve.\r\n\r\nRemember that the fifth dot in any Attribute costs two of the dots you have to spend at character creation. Each Attribute also gets one free dot automatically before you start assigning anything.'),
(4, 'skill', 'A character’s Attributes measure his innate physical, mental and social qualities — how strong he is, how quick he thinks on his feet, and how well he interacts with other people. The different ways in which a character can apply these Attributes are determined by his Skills. A character’s Skills reflect the education and training he’s acquired over the course of his life, and are a reflection of his origins and interests. Skills can be acquired in any number of ways, from institutionalized learning to hard, hands-on experience. A young recruit at the police academy is trained to use a handgun, while a gangbanger learns to shoot as a matter of survival.\r\n\r\nLike Attributes, Skills are broken down into three general categories: Mental, Physical and Social. A character’s initial Skills are purchased during character creation and are prioritized in the same manner as Attributes, with 11 points to allocate among primary Skills, seven points to allocate among secondary Skills, and four points to allocate among tertiary Skills. Skill dots can then be increased further using experience points (both at the conclusion of character creation if the Storyteller allows it, and later during play). Or new Skills can be purchased during a chronicle at the player’s discretion. For more information on selecting Skills for starting characters, see p. 34.\r\n\r\n> **Skill Dots**\r\n>\r\n> Skills are rated from 1 to 5, with each score suggesting your character’s relative level of proficiency and knowledge in that area. Dots Proficiency Level\r\n>\r\n> • Novice. Basic knowledge and/or techniques.\r\n>\r\n> •• Practitioner. Solid working knowledge and/or techniques.\r\n>\r\n> ••• Professional. Broad, detailed knowledge and/or techniques.\r\n>\r\n> •••• Expert. E xceptional depth of knowledge and/or techniques.\r\n>\r\n> ••••• Master. Unsurpassed depth of knowledge and/or techniques. A leader in the field.\r\n\r\n**Skill Specialties**\r\n\r\nSkills represent broad bases of knowledge and physical training in a given subject. An auto mechanic doesn’t just know about fixing engines, for example, but is versed in repairing tires, replacing windows and painting the body. In addition to this broad foundation of knowledge, characters can specialize in a particular aspect of a Skill, giving them an edge in a particular application due to their increased focus. There’s no limit to the number of Specialties that your character can have in a single Skill. You choose three Specialties at character creation. Any more must be purchased during play with experience points. Rolls involving a Skill Specialty gain a +1 modifier over and above any other situational modifiers. So, if your character has Crafts, but also has a Specialty in Automobiles, you gain a +1 bonus when he works on cars.\r\n\r\nYou are limited only by your imagination when devising your character’s Skill Specialties, although their focus should be fairly specific. A character possessing the Drive Skill might focus on sports cars, trucks, off-road or high-speed driving. Each Skill listed in this chapter has a number of suggested Specialties to give you an idea of the possibilities.\r\n\r\n**Skill Tasks**\r\n\r\nIf a Skill represents a particular body of knowledge or training, a Skill task describes a specific application of the Skill in question. Healing Wounds, for example, is a task describing an application of the Medicine Skill. Skill tasks combine an applicable Attribute with the Skill, plus any relevant equipment modifiers to form a dice pool, minus any situational modifiers. Climbing a steep cliff, for example, is a Skill task combining Strength + Athletics + equipment such as rope, pitons and cleats. Many Skills in this chapter have one or more tasks associated with them that suggest different ways in which the traits can be applied in various situations. Use these as guidelines for determining other Skill tasks that arise in your stories.\r\n\r\n**The Right Tools for the Job**\r\n\r\nHaving the proper equipment for a task can often mean the difference between success and failure. In addition to situational modifiers and Specialties, Skill rolls gain bonus dice if your character uses high-quality or specialized equipment when performing a feat. For example, a driver with a high-performance sports car has an edge in a race over someone in an old pickup. See “Equipment,” p. 139, in Chapter 6 for more information on the gear available to your character. Each task presented in this chapter lists a variety of tools that could provide bonus dice to your Skill roll. These lists are by no means exhaustive. You’re encouraged to employ other types of tools or equipment to assist in performing a task, but the Storyteller is the final arbiter on what bonus, if any, gear provides. It’s possible that using poor-quality tools might even make a task more difficult to perform, so choose wisely.'),
(5, 'devotion', 'The rote Disciplines that are common to all Kindred are not the only supernatural capabilities at their disposal. Every so often, an entirely new Discipline “technique,” formed by a curious combination of two or more standard powers, emerges from the ranks of the undead. Like standard Disciplines, these techniques — called Devotions — can be learned from or taught to other Kindred in much the same time frame and manner as the broader powers from which they originate. Any vampire with the appropriate prerequisite Discipline dots can, in theory, develop the Devotions for which he qualifies. It’s simply a matter of time and effort.\r\n\r\nSome claim to have truly secret Devotions, however, and the claim does have some basis in truth. Kindred may find themselves incapable of developing some of the more esoteric techniques without a learned mentor at their side. Indeed, not all Kindred have even heard of Devotions. By their nature, they are far rarer than the common Disciplines are, and knowledge of them is a bit more fleeting than the understanding of the unique Disciplines that sometimes accompany the creation of new bloodlines. Only a relative handful of Kindred possess Devotions, and fewer still have been wise enough to create their own. Kindred may learn of them through a “secret knowledge” a sire wishes to pass on to them, the confidences of a mentor, stolen wisdom in the hands of rebellious vampires, or by any other manner in which they come up in a story.\r\n\r\nAlthough any Kindred can potentially learn any Devotion as long as she has the Discipline prerequisites, some measure of “creator’s pride” exists pertaining to each, depending upon who claims to have developed the power first. Most of the Devotions stemming from and involving the Protean Discipline are known as Gangrel Devotions, for example, while those involving Theban Sorcery are referred to as Lancea Sanctum Devotions.\r\n\r\nThe following are sample Devotions that vampires might encounter and learn. Remember that if a Devotion is turned against or applied to a vampire with whom the user has a blood tie (see p. 162), a +2 bonus is gained on the power’s activation roll. For information on creating one’s own Devotions, see p. 265.');

The character does not have any choice over who he “becomes,” but he does know exactly who he’s supposed to be, even if he has never met that person before. The character gains the knowledge mystically and may act accordingly. The information drawn from the subject’s mind even allows the Kindred to custom-tailor certain aspects of the power to her.

Picture Perfect activates once in each scene a character (a “target”) views an image created with the Devotion. At Storyteller discretion, it may also activate when a target views an image painted, sculpted or drawn by an artist under the effects of the Picture Perfect Devotion. The first time a target encounters a Picture Perfect image, they are affected as if the vampire had used Awe upon them. Subsequent viewings of the same image do not create the same effect supernaturally, but the target is unlikely to change his overall opinion of the picture. Viewings of further Picture Perfect images in the same scene are affected by the initial Awe, but do not have a supernatural effect of their own. They may, however, have that effect when viewed in subsequent scenes.\n\nLater, when a target encounters the vampire or someone closely resembling her, he is overwhelmed by familiarity and affected by Awe again.

Moreover, any Kindred can counterfeit life for a short time, enough to keep down a meal or engage in carnal intercourse. This Blush of Life, however, is all too fleeting and all too tantalizing to the Beast’s hungers.

Lesser creatures grow agitated in the presence of the undead and normally flee the scene (or, in some cases, attack the vampire in question). Kindred who possess Animalism are a very different story. Animals are often attracted to such Kindred, and **their presence is soothing** even to restless beasts.\n\nOther sentient, supernatural beings such as shapechangers who have animal form or who can assume animal form are **not** affected by **Animalism**. Their intelligence makes them the purview of the Dominate Discipline. Similarly, Animalism is **useless** on another vampire who assumes wolf or another bestial form. Animalism is of no avail to the vampire in regard to such intelligent beings.\n\nNote that any Animalism power that requires eye contact is made **more difficult if the subject does not stand still** or is not otherwise immobilized.

Such premonitions might come as quick flashes of imagery, overwhelming feelings of empathy or even as an ominous sense of foreboding. The Kindred has absolutely no control over these insights, but he can learn to interpret their significance given time and experience.\n\nSuch potent sensitivity can have its drawbacks, however. When a vampire actively uses any level of Auspex save the fifth (Twilight Projection), he runs the risk of his delicate senses being overwhelmed by excessive stimuli. Sudden or severe occurrences such as a gun report or flash bulb in the eyes can distract the character unless the player succeeds on a **Resolve roll**.

The Discipline can therefore be used on only one subject at a time, and is **useless if eye contact is not possible**.\n\nDominate does not grant the ability to make oneself understood or to communicate mentally. Commands must be issued verbally, though certain simple commands (such as “Go over there!” indicated with a pointed finger and a forceful expression) may be conveyed by signs at the Storyteller’s discretion. No matter how powerful a vampire is, **she cannot force her victim to obey if she cannot make herself understood** — if, for example, the victim doesn’t speak the same language, she cannot hear or the orders simply make no sense.\n\nNote that victims of Dominate **might realize** what’s been done to them. That is, they do not automatically sense that they are being controlled, but they might subsequently wonder why they suddenly acted as they did. Wise Kindred, especially those familiar with Dominate, are likely to figure it out in the moment, and few vampires take kindly to being manipulated in such a fashion. Most Kindred who develop Dominate are forceful, controlling personalities, and they can make a reputation for themselves if they use this Discipline wantonly.\n\nIn all cases, a dramatic failure while attempting to Dominate a victim renders the would-be victim **immune to the character’s Dominate until the next sunset**.\n\nDominate is far more effective against mortals than it is against other Kindred. Most Dominate abilities described here allow the victim to struggle against the effects; that is, a contested roll is made against the Dominator’s player. As no mortal has Blood Potency, the vast majority of humans are at a disadvantage when dealing with the Discipline.\n\nDominate is also more effective against those whom the user has subjected to a Vinculum. A regnant may use Dominate powers (with the exception of Conditioning) on a thrall **without the need for eye contact**; the thrall merely has to hear the regnant’s voice.\n\nOther sentient, supernatural beings such as shapechangers who have animal form or who can assume animal form are affected by Dominate rather than by Animalism. A vampire can therefore try to ply his will on a werewolf — even a werewolf in wolf form — by using Dominate. Similarly, Animalism is useless against another vampire who assumes wolf or another bestial form. Animalism is of no avail to the vampire in regard to such intelligent beings.\n\nNote that any Dominate power requiring eye contact is made more difficult if the subject is not standing still or otherwise immobilized.

Majesty is perhaps the most versatile of Disciplines, for its potential uses and applications are both varied and multitudinous. The more savvy the practitioner, the more use he can get out of each of the Discipline’s levels.', 0, 'Unlike some other Disciplines, Majesty can be used on entire crowds of targets simultaneously, making it even more potent— in the right hands.\n\nThe only requirement for use of most Majesty powers is that **any potential targets see the character**. Eye contact is not required, nor is the ability to hear the character (though it certainly doesn’t hurt).\n\nThe downside to Majesty, such as is it is, is that its subjects retain their free will. Unlike victims of Dominate, who follow the commands of the Kindred nearly mindlessly, those acting under Majesty are simply emotionally predisposed to do whatever the power (or its user) suggests. While retention of personality makes victims more useful in the long run, it also means they require more care in handling than targets of Dominate. An abused victim of Majesty certainly subverts or represses what his emotions suggest in order to behave in the most appropriate manner. Meanwhile, subjects treated well might be persuaded to act against even their own interests.\n\nAny mortal can resist Majesty for one turn if a Willpower point is spent and a successful Composure roll is made (though the Willpower point does not add three dice to the roll). This roll is reflexive. If the roll fails, the Willpower point is lost and the target remains under the effects of the power(s). If the roll is successful, the mortal probably spends his turn of “freedom” fleeing the vampire’s proximity, lest he continue to be affected. Refusing to pay attention to the vampire, rather than fleeing, can allow a mortal to resist the spell for a turn, but the power resumes effect if the mortal remains in the Kindred’s vicinity.\n\nVampires resist Majesty in much the same way (by spending a Willpower point), but Blood Potency is added to Composure rolls made for them. In addition, **vampires of higher Blood Potency than the character invoking Majesty are able to resist his power for the entire scene** with the expenditure of one Willpower point and a successful Composure + Blood Potency roll.\n\nBy and large, the Kindred who choose to develop their Majesty abilities are those who recognize that one achieves more with honey than with vinegar. Those who swear by Majesty often find Dominate, seen as “the flip side of Majesty,” to be both boorish and crass, and they would swear to calling upon it only in times of dire need.', NULL, 2, 128, 'Control over emotions', 0, 0, 0),

They learn to bear that which is terrifying or unholy about their spirits, manifesting their inhumanity in their appearance or letting unfortunate onlookers peer deep into the creatures’ depraved souls.\n\nThe results can take a jaded individual aback or subject an unsuspecting victim to a fatal physiological reaction (to literally be frightened to death).\n\nPractitioners of Nightmare explore this route to power for different reasons. One vampire might exult in his inhuman nature and enjoy lording over lessers. The Discipline offers immediate gratification, and these Kindred display what is hideous about themselves to everyone, hiding it only insofar as they must in order to observe the secrecy of the Traditions. Other undead recognize the wisdom or even benevolence that fear affords. What better way to deal with a problem or avoid a confrontation than by frightening away an opponent? How better to protect someone from harm than by scaring her off? And if one seeks solitude, striking fear is certainly more effective than issuing threats, trying to reason with would-be intruders or orchestrating ever more elaborate means by which to hide.\n\nAll uses of Nightmare gain a +2 bonus if the individual power is turned on a vampire with whom the user has a Blood Tie. Naturally, this bonus does not apply to the subject’s resistance.', NULL, 2, 133, 'Control over fear', 0, 0, 0),

From hiding minute objects to the ability to appear as someone else to the power to fade from sight entirely, the Discipline of Obfuscate grants the Kindred uncanny powers of concealment, stealth and deception.', 0, 'Obfuscate clouds the mind in practice. For example, a character hiding an object by using this Discipline doesn’t actually make the object disappear, nor does someone using the Discipline to hide himself truly vanish. Rather, the mind sees “around” the Obfuscated object, refusing to acknowledge it, even if that requires a bit of filling in mental blanks. To continue the example, if a character Obfuscated a large sheet of plywood and tried to hide behind it herself, those looking at the plywood would, indeed, see the character lurking behind it but not see the plywood itself.\n\nThe shroud of Obfuscate is very difficult to penetrate. Few Kindred or other supernatural creatures can see through it, and only under the rarest of circumstances do mortals have any hope. Because they operate on a less conscious and mostly instinctual level, however, animals often perceive a vampire’s presence — and react with appropriate fear or hostility — even if they cannot detect him with their normal senses. Similarly, children, the mentally ill and others who see the world in ways not quite normal might pierce the deception at the Storyteller’s discretion.\n\nSome Kindred with Auspex are able to see through Obfuscate, or at least sense the presence of a supernatural deception. Refer to the “Clash of Wills” for details.\n\nIt’s important to note that Obfuscate affects the viewer’s mind, rather than making any true physical change to the vampire. Thus, the Discipline is not effective at cloaking a character from mechanical devices. Photographs, video cameras and the like record the normal blurred image that all vampires leave in such media, not the assumed appearance.\n\nObfuscate does affect any individual currently using the recording device, however, so someone videotaping an Obfuscated vampire sees the illusion when looking through the lens, discovering the truth only later when he reviews the tape itself.\n\nUnless stated otherwise, Obfuscate powers require very little concentration to maintain once invoked, and they last for the duration of a scene.', NULL, 2, 135, 'Supernatural deception', 0, 0, 0),
(8, 'Protean', 'Easily one of the most overtly spectacular of the gifts of the Damned, the Discipline of Protean is the study of physical metamorphosis and transformation. The nature of this power is hotly debated among the Kindred, for its abilities are so varied while simultaneously stemming from no obvious aspect of the Curse.

(1, 'Feral Whispers', 1, '> The Kindred with this ability has learned to understand the lesser creatures that surround her, and to speak with them and make herself understood.\n\n**Rank:** •  \n **Action:** Instant  \n **Cost:** —  \n **Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Animal Ken + Animalism\n\n**Roll Results**  \n **Success:** Success indicates that the character can fully communicate with the animal, to whatever degree it is capable.  \n **Exceptional Success:** Exceptional success indicates that the animal is not only communicative but actively helpful, even volunteering information unasked if it considers that information important (so far as its intelligence allows).  \n **Failure:** Failure indicates that the character cannot communicate with the animal.  \n **Dramatic Failure:** A dramatic failure indicates that the character misreads the animal, gaining false information. Additionally, the animal is immune to any further uses of **Animalism** by that character until the next sunset.\n\nIt is the foundation upon which all other Animalism abilities are built, for without understanding there can be no obedience.\n\nThe vampire must initiate eye contact with the animal in question; doing so forges a strong empathic bond between Kindred and beast, allowing communication. This contact is at least partially mental.\n\nThe vampire may either whisper to the animal in her own language (or any language she knows), or she may hiss, bark, chirp or make whatever sounds the animal might use to express itself.\n\n> Some Kindred prefer the latter, feeling that it joins them more closely with the animal in question, though many others deride them for it and consider the practice vulgar.\n\nThe animal, in turn, might make some sort of noise while responding. It might be a growl, a low chirp or anything else. The precise nature of the sound is irrelevant, as the meaning is conveyed mostly via the empathic link. Most animals instinctively respond quietly when answering Feral Whispers, unless the situation is a tense or violent one.\n\nThe Kindred must maintain either eye contact or a constant dialogue with the animal. If she fails to do so for even a single turn, the link is broken and she must reinitiate contact if she wishes to speak further.', 1, 'Speak with animals'),
(2, 'Obedience', 1, '> Having mastered the ability to commune with beasts, the Kindred’s connection with his own feral nature now allows him to command them as well. No longer need he beg, threaten or cajole animals into doing his will. He demands, and they obey as best they can.\n\n**Rank:** ••  \n **Action:** Instant  \n **Cost:** —  \n **Dice Pool:** Presence + Animal Ken + Animalism – animal’s Composure  \n **Special:** Obedience also requires a contested roll if the animal is already under the control of another Kindred with this power (in which case Obedience successes achieved must exceed those rolled for the original vampire).\n\n**Roll Results**  \n **Success:** Success indicates that the animal obeys the character’s orders to the best of its abilities.  \n **Exceptional Success:** Exceptional success indicates that the animal develops a strong, if temporary, affection for the character. It attempts to please and to anticipate orders, even when not actively following a specific command.  \n **Failure:** Failure indicates that the character cannot command or communicate with the animal.  \n **Dramatic Failure:** Dramatic failure indicates that the animal either attacks the character or does the exact opposite of what he commands it to do. In addition, that animal is immune to any further use of **Animalism** by that character until the next sunset.\n\nThe vampire must make eye contact, as with **Feral Whispers**, and convey to an animal precisely what he wants it to do.\n\nThe animal obeys to the best of its ability, but its nature and intelligence might cause it to interpret its orders in unusual ways. Once it has received an order, the animal carries it out, assuming it can be completed before the following sunrise.\n\n**At dawn, the compulsion ceases**, regardless of whether the task is complete or not.', 2, 'Command animals'),
(3, 'Call of the Wild', 1, '> The Kindred is so fully in tune with her own Beast that she can call out in a feral voice — howling, hissing, cawing or the like — that beckons all creatures of a specific type. Any animal of that sort within a given area is compelled to respond, immediately moving toward the Kindred at its fastest possible speed, via the most direct route it can find.\n\n**Rank:** •••  \n **Action:** Instant  \n **Cost:** 1 Vitae  \n **Dice Pool:** Presence + Animal Ken + Animalism\n\n**Roll Results**  \n **Success:** The area of the call is 100 meters for every success rolled. That is, a single success when summoning rats calls all rats within 100 meters. The Storyteller determines how many animals respond based on the environment. Hundreds or thousands of rats might appear in an inner city, while no hawks or coyotes would.  \n **Exceptional Success:** As per a normal success.  \n **Failure:** On a failure, no animals appear.  \n **Dramatic Failure:** All animals of the type called within 100 meters immediately turn hostile toward the character and are immune to any further uses of Animalism by that character until the next sunset.\n\nOnly animals that can **hear** the call are summoned, so creatures that have been deafened or that are insulated from the sound by thick walls or other barriers do not respond. Additionally, **only** natural animals respond to this call — no **hell hounds** or **gargoyles**, for example, answer it.\n\nAnimals that respond to the Kindred’s call **are not automatically under her control**, but they are more easily subjected to other Animalism powers.\n\n**Suggested Modifiers**\n\nThe Storyteller may impose bonuses or penalties to the call based on weather, barriers or other ambient noise, as he feels is appropriate.\n\nA heavy wind might cut down the distance the sound can travel, for instance, imposing a -2 penalty.\n\nAnimals responding to **Call of the Wild** are easier for the beckoning character to influence with other uses of Animalism.  \n Any further use of Animalism on these specific creatures receives a **bonus equal to the number of successes** on the roll to invoke this power. This bonus lasts for the remainder of the scene.', 3, 'Summon animals'),
(4, 'Subsume the Lesser Spirit', 1, '> By locking eyes with an animal, a vampire may psychically enter the creature’s body and possess it as though it were his own. Some Kindred believe that doing so actually transfers the vampire’s soul into the beast, though other, less mystically minded Kindred disagree. Regardless, the animal’s own mind and instincts are completely subsumed, allowing the Kindred free reign to take whatever action she chooses in the creature’s body.\n> \n> The vampire’s own body falls into a torpor-like state and appears for all intents and purposes to be a corpse. Until the character returns, his body cannot be awakened by any means (though Kindred urban legends tell of ghosts possessing such bodies and wreaking havoc). Also, it is whispered among certain circles that some vampires, addicted to the sensations of life they experience while riding an animal, remain too long in that form and forget their true nature.\n\n**Rank:** ••••  \n **Action:** Contested  \n **Cost:** 1 Vitae  \n **Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Animal Ken + Animalism versus animal’s Composure\n\n**Roll Results**  \n **Success:** The character wins the contested action and occupies the animal’s body. He can use **Animalism** but no other Disciplines while doing so.  \n **Exceptional Success:** The character wins the contested action with five or more successes and occupies the animal’s body, and can also use **Auspex** and **Majesty** while doing so.  \n **Failure:** The character loses or ties the contested action and fails to bond with the animal.  \n **Dramatic Failure:** The character fails to bond with the animal; the animal grows hostile and is immune to any further uses of **Animalism** by that character until the next sunset.\n\nIf the roll made for the character wins the contested roll and gets successes **in excess** of the animal’s Composure dots, the character is in total control and his mind remains clear.\n\nHowever if his roll succeeds but garners a number of successes **equal to or lower** than the animal’s Composure dots, a **Willpower** point must be spent for the character to take any actions contrary to the animal’s instincts.\\\\Otherwise, bestial urges and impulses cloud the vampire’s mind.\n\nAdditionally, his character’s consciousness is so closely intertwined with the beast’s that he maintains some bestial behaviors even after returning to his own form.  \n Until the player spends a total of three Willpower points specifically to overcome this effect — the points can’t, say, be spent to gain three extra dice in unrelated rolls — the character continues to think and feel in an animalistic manner.\n\n> This effect has no “hard” mechanical applications, but it should be roleplayed. If the character doesn’t indulge in animalistic activity, the Storyteller should feel free to either dock the character future experience points or spend Willpower automatically for the character when a particularly bestial response is appropriate but not displayed.\n\nWhile possessing an animal, a character can travel as far from his own body as he wishes and is unharmed by daylight, but he must still force himself to stay awake during the day. The vampire may choose to end the possession and return to his body at any time, regardless of distance. This occurs automatically if the vampire fails to remain awake. Any injuries inflicted on the animal also affect the vampire’s body. If the animal dies while the vampire is still present, the Kindred falls into torpor immediately.(Some believe that the soul attempts to find its way back to its own body during this time.)\n\nIf the Kindred’s physical form is destroyed, his psyche remains trapped in the animal until he finally fails to remain awake, at which point his spirit is lost to oblivion and is unrecoverable.\n\nIt is possible, though uncommon, for a vampire to neglect his physical body long enough for it to starve into torpor while he’s “out.” If a vampire’s dormant body slips or is forced into torpor, the vampire’s spirit automatically returns to its body.', 4, 'Possess an animal'),
(5, 'Leashing the Beast', 1, '> The vampire’s connection with the Beast is so powerful that she can manipulate not only the lesser creatures around her, but her own Beast and that of other Kindred.\n\n**Rank:** •••••  \n **Action:** Instant (to affect oneself) or Contested; resistance is reflexive (to affect another)  \n **Cost:** 1 Vitae  \n **Dice Pool**(oneself): Manipulation + Empathy + Animalism  \n **Dice Pool**(another): Manipulation + Empathy + Animalism versus Composure + Blood Potency\n\n**Roll Results**  \n **Success**(oneself): The instant action inspires or calms rage frenzy or Rötschreck in the character herself.  \n **Success**(another): The character gets the most successes and manipulates another’s Beast. Frenzy or Rötschreck rules apply as normal for the remainder of the scene if either is induced.  \n **Exceptional Success:** The character fulfills the instant action or wins the contested roll with five or more successes, and the subject is immediately forced into (or out of) frenzy or Rötschreck. If the subject is forced into frenzy or Rötschreck, he or she remains in that state for the remainder of the scene, regardless of surrounding events or circumstances. Additionally, Willpower cannot be spent to end the frenzy prematurely. If the subject is brought out of frenzy or Rötschreck, he or she is not subject to frenzy or Rötschreck for the remainder of the scene, regardless of surrounding events or circumstances.  \n **Failure:** The character fails the instant action, or loses or ties the contested action and the power fails.  \n **Dramatic Failure**(oneself): The opposite kind of frenzy sought is invoked (Rötschreck when rage frenzy was intended).  \n **Dramatic Failure**(another): The character’s power rebounds and a Willpower point must be spent or she enters either frenzy or Rötschreck, whichever she attempted to influence. Additionally, the subject is immune to any further **Leashing the Beast** attempts by the character until the next sunset.\n\nThis is not overt control, as with \\[\\[#Obedience|Obedience\\]\\] or the \\[\\[Dominate\\]\\] Discipline. Rather, the Kindred learns to rouse the Beast’s instincts, inspiring it — and thus the vampire within whom it lurks — to behave in a certain manner.  \n Of course, communing with the Beast is dangerous even under the best of circumstances, and a few unfortunate Kindred have been destroyed by their own failed attempts to manipulate others’ Beasts.\n\nThe subject must be a vampire and must be within the character’s line of sight. (If the character makes herself the subject, she need not be able to see, so she can do so even in complete darkness or when otherwise blinded.) The player must decide to invoke a **rage frenzy** or **Rötschreck**, or to alleviate either of them.\n\n**Suggested Modifiers**\n\nIf the character knows another’s **Virtue** and/or **Vice**, such knowledge grants a **+1 bonus**, though she must cajole the Beast by specifically focusing on those aspects of the subject’s personality. These bonuses are not cumulative. Knowing a character’s Virtue and Vice nets only a +1 bonus, **not** a +2.\n\nIf this power is turned on a vampire with whom the user has a **blood tie**, a **+2 bonus** is gained.\n\nIf the character is already in frenzy and uses this power to calm herself, a **-2 penalty** applies.', 5, 'Control self and other\'s Beast'),
(6, 'Heightened Senses', 2, '> When this power is activated, all of the vampire’s senses sharpen to a razor’s edge, effectively doubling both the range and clarity of all stimuli received.\n> \n> Heightened eyesight allows the vampire to perceive the most minute details of objects at great distances, while a heightened sense of smell might alert a character to the presence of trace amounts of alcohol on a mortal’s breath.\n\n**Rank:** •  \n **Action:** Instant  \n **Cost:** —  \n **Dice Pool:** This power typically involves no roll. The player simply activates the power and explains to the Storyteller what his character is doing and with which sense(s). The Storyteller responds by relating whatever information can be gleaned. The only time a roll comes into play for **Heightened Senses** is when the Storyteller wishes to permit the character a chance to perceive an imminent threat. In this case, the Storyteller may allow the player to add her character’s Auspex dots to a **surprise roll**.\n\n**Special**: This power allows a vampire to see in pitch-black darkness.', 1, 'increase sight, hearing, and oflactory'),
(7, 'Aura Perception', 2, '> With this mystic power, a vampire can open his perceptions to the psychic auras that surround all sentient creatures. Numerous and often-shifting hues and patterns compose these auras, and it can take many years before a vampire becomes truly proficient at reading them correctly with any degree of regularity. Although the strongest emotions predominate, almost every individual has more than one color to his aura at any given time, and an observer can see any number of streaks or flashes of these other colors.\n\n**Rank:** ••  \n **Action:** Instant +2 full turns (Though this is an instant action, it takes more than just a fleeting glance to see the detail in an aura. A character must scrutinize her subject’s aura for two full turns to glean information from it, though only the single, immediate roll is necessary to determine if she can read it successfully.)  \n **Cost:** —  \n **Dice Pool:** Intelligence + Empathy + Auspex – subject’s Composure  \n **Special:** The degree of information provided by **Aura Perception** depends on the number of dices removed from the pool.\n\n**Roll Results**  \n **Success:** The character perceives a number of colors in the subject’s aura equal to the number of successes obtained on the roll.  \n **Exceptional Success:** As per a normal success, with one additional color or degree of emotional intensity discernible to the character.  \n **Failure:** The character can distinguish no information at all.  \n **Dramatic Failure:** The character gleans utterly misleading and wholly inaccurate information.\n\nNote that a failure indicates that no useful information is perceived, while a dramatic failure indicates a false or misleading reading.  \n The Storyteller may therefore wish to make the roll for the player, to keep the true results secret.\n\n“Psychic colors” change with the subject’s mental or emotional state, creating an ever-moving pattern that is as unique to each person as a fingerprint. As a rule, the more powerful the emotions, the more intense the colors, but even this guideline is betrayed by any number of mitigating factors, depending on circumstance. All the same, practice makes perfect; a true master aura-perceiver learns to understand the significance of each whorl and eddy.\n\nDue to the peculiar nature of such creatures’ auras, this power can be used as a means of detecting other supernatural entities. Vampire auras, for example, tend to be extremely pale, regardless of the colors. Werewolf auras are quite the contrary, nearly frantic in their intensity. Mage auras sparkle with power. Ghostly auras flicker like guttering candles.\n\nAn Auspex user who observes someone in the act of lying may recognize that the subject speaks falsely. Intelligence + Empathy + Auspex is rolled versus the subject’s Composure in a contested action. The Auspex user recognizes the lie if the most successes are rolled for him.\n\nApplied toward reading the mood of potential combatants, this power also grants its user a bonus to Initiative equal to the number of successes rolled in activating the effect. Doing so requires that the vampire speaks to or is in the proximity of intended combatants for at least one turn before a fight breaks out. That period of interaction allows the reading vampire to recognize that events are about to turn violent, so he can react with advanced knowledge.\n\nAURA SIGNIFIERS\n\n**Condition — Color**  \n Afraid — Orange  \n Aggressive — Purple  \n Angry — Bright Red  \n Bitter — Brown  \n Calm — Light Blue  \n Compassionate — Pink  \n Conservative — Lavender  \n Depressed — Gray  \n Desirous/Lustful — Deep Red  \n Distrustful — Light Green  \n Envious — Dark Green  \n Excited — Violet  \n Generous — Rose  \n Happy — Vermilion  \n Hateful — Black  \n Idealistic — Yellow  \n Innocent — White  \n Lovestruck — Bright Blue  \n Obsessed — Bright Green  \n Sad — Silver  \n Spiritual — Gold  \n Suspicious — Dark Blue  \n Confused — Mottled, shifting colors  \n Daydreaming — Sharp, flickering colors  \n Diablerist — Black veins in aura  \n Dominated — Controlled Weak, muted aura  \n Frenzied — Rapidly rippling colors  \n Psychotic — Hypnotic, swirling colors  \n Vampire — Aura colors are pale  \n Shapeshifter — Intensely vibrant aura  \n Ghost — Splotchy, intermittent aura  \n Magic Use — Myriad sparkles in aura', 2, 'sense emotions'),
(8, 'The Spirit’s Touch', 2, '> The Kindred’s powers of perception have progressed to the point that he can pick up psychic impressions from objects simply by handling them for a moment or two. Such impressions can tell the vampire who last held the object, when it was last held and even what was done with it in the past.\n\n**Rank:** •••  \n **Action:** Instant  \n **Cost:** —  \n **Dice Pool:** Wits + Occult + Auspex\n\n**Roll Results**  \n **Success:** Success yields a sense of the previous handler or owner’s identity, as well as a reliable vision or sense of the memory in question.  \n **Exceptional Success:** An exceptional success provides a comprehensive or extended chronological understanding of the event and its participants, such as an entire slideshow of images pertaining to the object and its past.  \n **Failure:** Failure indicates that no impressions come through.  \n **Dramatic Failure:** A dramatic failure indicates the psychic equivalent of a “mixed message” or a very believable but entirely false impression.\n\nThese psychic impressions typically come in the form of quick and cryptic images, and as with other Auspex powers, learning how to decipher the information gleaned can be a task all its own. Most impressions (and therefore, most visuals stemming from them) pertain to the last person who handled the object in question, but two circumstances usually preclude such a reading. First, a long-time owner or handler of the object leaves stronger impressions than someone who handled it briefly, if more recently. Second, experiences associated with great emotion — be it hate, passion or fear —often linger in the form of intense psychic impressions on objects. It is these impressions that likely come to the fore over anything more recent or, in all likelihood, far less emotionally significant.\n\nAll that is required in order to glean information from an object by using this power is that the vampire turn the item over in his hands (or otherwise handle it) for a few moments, during which he enters a shallow trance. This trance is the gateway through which psychic snapshots arrive, and anything that prematurely disrupts the trance likely prevents any useful information from being received.\n\nThis power can also be used to glimpse the past of another. The subject must be touched, which could require a roll if the subject is \\[\\[Combat#Dodge|resistant\\]\\]\n\n**Action:** Contested  \n **Dice Pool:** Wits + Occult +Auspex versus the subject’s Resolve + Blood Potency\n\n**Roll Results**  \n **Success:** The most successes are rolled for the reading character. A distorted and blurred glimpse of the event or situation in question passes through his mind. He is left with an intuitive, general understanding of what transpired.  \n **Exceptional Success:** The reading character wins the contested roll with five or more successes. An instantaneous glimpse of the event or situation in question passes through his mind. He implicitly understands every aspect of what happened, essentially as if he were there in the subject’s stead. The reader doesn’t acquire any new traits or capabilities —say, if the subject committed diablerie. The reader simply knows what transpired.  \n **Failure:** The contested roll is lost or tied. No impressions come through.  \n **Dramatic Failure:** Events witnessed from the subject’s eyes are misinterpreted. He seems to have been attacked rather than to have initiated an attack, for example.\n\nThe subject’s roll is reflexive, and he does not know that past events in his existence are perceived.\n\nIf the reader gets the most successes, a vision is received of the subject’s past, all from the subject’s perspective.\n\nWith no time frame or criteria for the event witness, the last dramatic, tense or passionate act performed or experienced by the subject is glimpsed.\n\nIf a specific timeframe or event is focused on, the Auspex user’s roll suffers a **-1 penalty for each night** that has passed since the event.', 3, 'See psychic residues of the past'),
(9, 'Telepathy', 2, '> At this level of advancement of one’s extrasensory perceptions, a vampire may project his consciousness into a nearby individual’s mind. Doing so creates a mental link whereby the Kindred can communicate silently or even scan the surface of the target’s subconscious. The user senses any thought picked up as a voice inside his own mind, and the data can hardly be considered unobtrusive. Nevertheless, this power has the potential to be one of the most potent of the abilities in any vampire’s mystical arsenal. With enough practice, a vampiric telepath can uncover nearly any secret from any sentient being around him.\n\n**Rank:** ••••  \n **Action:** Instant  \n **Cost:** None for a mortal; 1 Willpower for a supernatural subject unless the supernatural subject is willing.  \n **Dice Pool:** Intelligence + Socialize + Auspex – subject’s Resolve  \n **Special:** The degree of information provided by **Aura Perception** depends on the number of dices removed from the pool.\n\n**Roll Results**  \n **Success:** Success allows a character to read from or add a thought to the subject’s mind. See the suggested modifiers list that follows for specific applications of the **Telepathy** power.  \n **Exceptional Success:** Exceptional success at **Telepathy** allows the character to gain an additional piece of information (or an additional aspect to the original insight).  \n **Failure:** Failure results in no link being established, and the character cannot try again for the remainder of the scene.  \n **Dramatic Failure:** Dramatic failure on a **Telepathy** attempt can be disastrous, as the user instantly adopts any derangements present in the target for the rest of the night.\\\\\n\nNote that the player of any subject who is aware that he is being probed or “ridden” may spend a Willpower point to eject the telepath. Each time the telepath sends a message, the subject instantly becomes aware that the thought didn’t originate from his own mind. Each time the telepath digs out a piece of data, Intelligence + Composure is rolled for the subject to detect the intruder.\n\nTelepathy is most effective on the mortal mind. When used on ordinary people, the character can maintain a link as long as he keeps concentrating, and as long as the mortal target does not leave his line of sight for more than a moment or two.\n\nTrying to breach the supernatural mind, however, is a more difficult prospect. A given link is good only for the moment and must be reestablished each time the character wishes to send or dig for thoughts.', 4, 'Communicate mind by mind and read surface thoughts'),
(10, 'Twilight Projection', 2, '> Commonly seen as the pinnacle of Auspex achievement, this power allows a vampire to project her perceptions out of her physical body. Her senses take on an existence of their own, traveling the material world like a spectre.\n\n> Such a form,called a “ghost body,” is immune to fatigue and physical harm, and it can fly at great speeds. Ghost bodies can even go underground at will — anywhere within and below the limit of the lunar sphere.\n\n**Rank:** •••••  \n **Action:** Instant  \n **Cost:** 1 Willpower  \n **Dice Pool:** Intelligence + Occult + Auspex  \n **Special:** The degree of information provided by **Aura Perception** depends on the number of dices removed from the pool.\n\n**Roll Results**  \n **Success:** The Kindred separates her ghost body from her physical body and may venture throughout the world.  \n **Exceptional Success:** As with a normal success, but the separation occurs with ease and the character regains the Willpower point spent.  \n **Failure:** The character cannot separate her consciousness from her body, but may try again at her next opportunity.  \n **Dramatic Failure:** Dramatic failures can be disastrous. They usually result in the character projecting successfully but being flung to an undesired destination (around the world or deep into an unknown place, for example).\n\nInteracting with the physical world or sprit world while using Twilight Projection is impossible. The character has no substance at all, not even spiritual substance — she is merely a projected consciousness. This state can be both a benefit and a drawback, in that the character is unimpeded by obstacles, but is also unable to affect any threats she encounters. It might come to pass that two vampires’ ghost bodies or a projected vampire and a genuine ghost encounter one another. They can communicate as if they were in the real world, but no sorts of physical or mystical exchanges can occur between them.\n\nA projected vampire’s psyche is invisible to most physical beings. A child or animal might intuitively sense the vampire’s presence, or even see him. Another Kindred using Heightened Senses or Aura Perception might spot the projected being by getting the most successes in a Wits + Investigation + Auspex (spotter) versus Resolve + Occult + Auspex (projector) contested roll. Both rolls are made reflexively.\n\nA projecting vampire’s other Disciplines do not work. Her spirit can certainly observe things, but its temporal connection to the body that serves as the conduit for the Kindred’s mystic curse is too tenuous for other mystical powers to manifest.\n\nWhile her consciousness roams, a vampire’s body lies in a torpor-like state on the spot where she left it. As long as her ghost body is active, the character remains ignorant of what goes on around her physical body. If the body is subjected to either torpor or Final Death, the projected psyche is pulled back immediately.\n\nA vampire’s body continues to expend Vitae nightly for the purposes of sustaining itself. The player must succeed on a standard Humanity roll for the ghost body to remain awake during the daytime. The consciousness of a vampire who falls asleep returns to her body and she rises the next night as normal, entirely within the physical world.\n\nA ghost body appears naked and with no possessions. Artifacts that are composed entirely of spirit matter might be employed in this form, but no physical objects transfer over. Likewise, any objects found during the wraithly endeavor cannot be manipulated or return with the character when she finally rejoins her physical body.\n\nA projecting vampire can potentially be barred mystically from returning to her body, or she might become lost and incapable of finding her body again. Rumors also speak of other spirits that can enter a vampire’s vacant body, stranding the Kindred as a ghost body. Denied her own body (or perhaps another one to possess), each night that passes for the ghost body removes a dot of Blood Potency from its essence. When those dots are reduced to zero, the ghost-Kindred suffers **Final Death** and fades into oblivion.\n\n**Suggested Modifiers**\n\nTypically, no modifiers are necessary, but the Storyteller may penalize the activation roll up to two dice in the event of a hastened projection, such as when a vampire abandons her body at the moment of Final Death (after all, a ghost body is better than no body at all).', 5, 'Project own senses into twilight'),
(11, NULL, 3, '**Action:** Reflexive  \n **Cost:** 1 Vitae per turn  \n **Dice Pool:** None  \n **Special:** A character may “pre-empt” her own action in a turn to activate Celerity if an opponent acts before her and the vampire wishes to call upon Celerity before the rival’s action is performed. The vampire therefore gets Celerity’s protection bonus early in the turn. Celerity’s Initiative bonus is also added immediately in the turn, potentially moving the vampire’s action before her attacker’s in the Initiative roster. The vampire also gains the benefit of additional Speed for the turn. If one Vitae is spent to keep Celerity active into the next turn, all of these benefits carry over.\n\nNote that Celerity is obviously superhuman in use. Few Princes smile upon uses of Celerity that leave too many curious mortal witnesses unaccounted for.\n\nCelerity cannot be invoked more than once per turn. That is, you may not spend a second Vitae and double the benefits of Celerity in a given turn, though you may spend Vitae across multiple turns to enjoy the benefits over those turns.\n\nIn turns when a character activates her Celerity, her dots in the Discipline are subtracted from any and all attacking characters’ dice pools, as the vampire moves much more quickly than normal and is harder to hit. This penalty to attackers’ pools applies in addition to any armor the Celerity-using character may have, as well as to Defense (though note, like armor, Celerity’s benefits do not diminish based on how many attacks the character faces). Celerity’s protection even applies against firearms.\n\nFor example, if a character has Celerity 3 and activates the Discipline, three dice are subtracted from any assailants’ dice pools.\n\nCelerity also adds to a character’s Initiative during the turnin which it is active. The aforementioned character with Celerity 3 and Initiative 5 would have a basic Initiative modifier of 8 during turns in which his Celerity is active.\n\nFinally, Celerity acts as a modifier to a character’s Speed while it is active. His Speed increases by itself again for each dot of Celerity he possesses. (Simply add one to the value of the character’s Celerity and multiply that number by his Speed.) Characters running while Celerity is active double this figure, as well.\n\nIf a vampire doesn’t activate Celerity until his stage of the Initiative roster in a turn, previous actions taken by others that turn aren’t invalidated. (They aren’t re-done because the vampire suddenly has a higher standing in the roster.) By activating Celerity “late” in the turn, the vampire forfeits his Initiative bonus that turn. The vampire also gains Celerity’s protection only against attacks that come after his place in the Initiative roster for the turn. If Celerity is kept active into the next turn, the vampire’s Initiative bonus and full protection applies throughout.', NULL, 'Bonus to Speed and Initiative and penalty to incoming attacks per dot'),
(12, 'Command', 4, '> Once he has established eye contact, the vampire issues a single, one-word command that must be obeyed instantly.\n\n**Rank:** •  \n **Action:** Contested; resistance is reflexive  \n **Cost:** —  \n **Dice Pool:** Intelligence + Intimidation + Dominate versus Resolve + Blood Potency\n\n**Roll Results**  \n **Success:** The character wins the contested roll by getting the most successes, and the victim obeys literally and with appreciable self-preservation.  \n **Exceptional Success:** The character wins the contested roll with five or more successes, and the victim not only obeys but rationalizes what she does as her own decision until and unless someone questions her about it in depth.  \n **Failure:** The character loses or ties the contested roll and the subject does not obey.  \n **Dramatic Failure:** The subject does not obey and is immune to the character’s Dominate until the next sunset.\n\nSpecial: Assuming the commanded action is one that can be carried out for some time, such as “wait” or “sleep,” the subject obeys for a number of turns equal to the successes obtained on the Command roll.\n\nThe order must be clear and straightforward — freeze, jump, run,stop, fall, cough, blink and so forth. If the command is ambiguous or confusing, the subject might respond slowly or perform the task poorly. Further, commands are always interpreted (within reason) in the subject’s best interests.\n\nFor example, if the victim stands on the edge of a roof and the character commands “Jump!” the victim might jump up and down, rather than leap off the roof.\n\nOf course, the victim would probably not leap off the roof even if the character could find a way to order it. Subjects of Command cannot be made to directly harm themselves, so an obviously suicidal order such as “Die!” is ineffective.\n\n“Sleep” and the like causes the subject to follow the order only if she does not believe herself to be in any mortal danger. A character seduced by a Kindred might sleep if so instructed, but one in the middle of a combat or interrogation certainly does not. In such situations, the character merely falls senseless, but only for a turn.\n\nThe vampire may include the command word in a sentence, in order to conceal her use of the power from others. The command itself must be stressed, and the character must make eye contact precisely when that word is spoken. Observers may notice the unusual emphasis, but only the most alert —and those familiar with the Discipline — are likely to realize what has occurred.\n\nIf this power is turned on a vampire with whom the user has a \\[\\[Blood Tie|blood tie\\]\\], a +2 bonus applies to the user’s roll.', 1, 'issue single word verbal command to target'),

The Kindred may activate the imposed thought or command immediately — “Walk over here and open the door” — or he may establish a stimulus that activates the suggestion at a later date — “When you see a man in a blue suit with a red rose in his lapel, you will spill your drink on him.”\n\nThe victim must be able to understand the vampire.\n\nThe Kindred must maintain eye contact only as long as it takes to implant the suggestion or idea.\n\nMesmerize can deliver truly complex and long-term commands, such as following someone, taking notes on her activities and reporting back on the first of the next month. A subject can have only one suggestion implanted at any given time.\n\nThis power lasts for as long as it takes the subject to carry out the required task, or until the character is destroyed or enters torpor. Impossible actions such as, “Count every grain of sand on this beach,” automatically fail to take root in the subject’s mind.\n\nIf, during the course of carrying out the implanted suggestion, the victim realizes he puts himself in danger or acts completely contrary to his normal moral code, **a Resolve roll may be made to shake off the compulsion**. This is a contested roll. Successes rolled must exceed the number of successes obtained for the dominating character when the individual was first mesmerized.\n\n**Action**: Contested  \n **Dice Pool**: Resolve + Blood Potency vs the number of successes obtained when first mesmerized.\n\n**Roll Results**  \n **Success**: The victim escapes the suggestion.  \n **Exceptional Success**: The victim defies the suggestion, and the dominator incurs a -1 penalty to future attempts to Dominate him until the next night.  \n **Failure**: The victim must continue to carry out the command as ordered.  \n **Dramatic Failure**: Not only must the subject continue to carry out the command, no more Resolve rolls may be made to shake the dominator’s control, no matter what the subject is forced to do.\n\nNo matter how strong the dominator’s will is or how many successes he obtains, he cannot make a subject harm himself directly. Any command to commit suicide is therefore ignored, although commands that are likely to lead to harm— such as, “Walk into that crack house and shoot the man in the red shirt” — are enforceable, but subject to the Resolve rolls discussed above.\n\nIf a vampire attempts to Mesmerize a subject who is already under the influence of a previously implanted directive, compare the successes rolled in the attempt against the successes gained during the implantation of the first suggestion. If the character obtains more successes than the previous Kindred, the new command may supplant the old one. If he does not, the original command remains active and the new one fails to take root. In case of a tie, the original command takes precedent over the new one.\n\nA vampire seeking to supplant an old suggestion with a new one must also acquire successes in excess of those rolled for the subject in his contested Resolve + Blood Potency roll.\n\nIf this power is turned on a vampire with whom the user has a \\[\\[Blood Tie|blood tie\\]\\], a +2 bonus applies to the user’s roll.', 2, 'Issue long, hypnotic command'),

All accumulated successes are lost and the subject continues to remember what happened.\n\n**Special:** Even a single success pacifies the victim for the length of time it takes to complete the process. Both vampire and subject must be safe and relatively composed when this power is used; it cannot be used to calm someone already in combat, for example.\n\nThe power, as with all uses of Dominate, requires eye contact. The Forgetful Mind does not allow for telepathic contact. Instead, the vampire acts much like a hypnotist, asking direct questions to draw answers from the subject, and then describing in detail any new memories she wishes to impose on the victim. Simple alterations, such as blurring brief and recent memories, are easy enough (and very effective for eliminating evidence of feeding or other Masquerade breaches). More comprehensive alterations, up to and including a complete reconstruction of the victim’s past and even identity, are possible albeit substantially more difficult.The victim’s subconscious struggles to resist false memories implanted from without, so the degree to which the vampire details new memories has direct bearing on how fully the subject assimilates them. An incomplete or simplistic false memory shatters much more swiftly and easily than does one with more attention to detail. For instance, “You drove home after work and had a very bad evening” is not likely to hold up. Far more effective would be an account such as:\n\n> “You left work late, due to a last-minute change ordered by the client. You still managed to get stuck in rush hour for an extra 25 minutes, and you were seriously frustrated by the time you pulled off the freeway. There weren’t even any good songs on the radio.\n> \n> Three blocks from home, a cop pulled you over for coasting through a stop sign. At least he only gave you a warning, but it was still just one more hassle.\n> \n> The frozen dinner you microwaved was awful, the TV movie starred some has-been you didn’t like, and the news was depressing.\n> \n> You finally turned off the TV in disgust and went to bed.”\n\nTruly effective use of The Forgetful Mind, then, requires substantial finesse and patience, as well as the ability to carefully and thoroughly think things through ahead of time. It’s fairly simple to sift through a victim’s memories and strip out recent events without even knowing precisely what happened, but doing so leaves a gap in the memory that can lead to further problems.\n\nMost people aren’t comfortable realizing they’ve lost a few hours or a night’s worth of memories, and they’re likely to try to find out what happened.Even new memories that the character imposes rarely have the same strength as the originals, and they can be broken or at least contradicted through investigation. For instance, a victim might not recall that she was attacked by a vampire, but she might remember being bitten, chalking it up to an animal attack or a spider. More vivid memories can return as snippets in dreams or be triggered by an unusual olfactory stimulus or spoken phrase. The process might take weeks or even years before the victim can begin to make sense of these flashes, but even the most effective memory manipulation is far from perfect — or truly permanent.\n\nA vampire may also use The Forgetful Mind to sense whether someone has had her memories altered in this fashion, and he can sometimes use his own power to draw forth and restore the original thoughts. No Kindred may use The Forgetful Mind to restore his own lost or altered memories, however.\n\nTo restore stolen or false memories, or to sense when memories have been altered, a character must possess Dominate at a level equal to or greater than that of the vampire who first tampered with the subject’s mind. If such is the case, the player then makes a contested roll in each stage of the extended action, to be compared against the initial user’s attempt, and must score more successes than the predecessor did.', 3, 'Manipulate target\'s memory');

(15, 'Conditioning', 4, '> Through constant veiled whispers, subtle hints and frequent sustained manipulation, a vampire can slowly render a particular victim substantially more suggestible. Conditioning is normally used only on favored or valuable servants and, over sufficient time, makes the character’s efforts to Dominate a subject far easier while making it harder for any other Kindred to do so. Acquiring such complete control over even the weakest mind is no easy task, however, and it normally takes weeks or even months to accomplish.\n\n**Rank:** ••••  \n **Action:** Contested and Extended (6-15+ successes; each roll represents one week of mental manipulation); resistance is reflexive  \n **Cost:** 1 Willpower per roll  \n **Dice Pool:** Wits + Subterfuge + Dominate versus Resolve + Blood Potency\n\n**Roll Results**  \n **Success:** The character wins a contested roll and makes progress in his efforts to suborn the subject’s will.  \n **Exceptional Success:** The character wins a contested roll with five or more successes and makes substantial progress in his efforts to suborn the subject’s will.  \n **Failure:** The character loses or ties a contested roll and the attempt fails.  \n **Dramatic Failure:** All of the user’s successes to date are negated and the subject is immune to the character’s Dominate until the next sunset.\n\nWhile they are undeniably loyal, servants subject to Conditioning lose much of their ability to think for themselves, their own personalities blotted out by the will imposed on them. They follow their orders literally and to the letter, rarely showing any imagination or judgment, or taking the initiative to act on their own. Some Kindred have remarked that, after a sufficiently lengthy period of Conditioning, their servants actually resemble the walking dead more so than their masters.\n\nMortals, thralls, other vampires and other supernatural creatures are all subject to Conditioning, if it can be performed on them over the required period of time.\n\nConditioning does not have any mechanical effect until five more successes are accumulated in excess of the victim’s Willpower dots. (If the subject has Willpower 6, Conditioning begins to take effect once 11 successes are achieved.) Once this benchmark has been reached, all future attempts by the character to use any Dominate ability (including further uses of Conditioning) on the victim receive a +1 bonus, and all attempts by other Kindred to Dominate the subject suffer a -1 penalty. For every additional five successes that are accumulated, the bonus and penalty each increase by one, to a maximum of +5 and -5. The Storyteller, not the player, should keep track of the number of successes accumulated.\n\nOnce the character’s bonus reaches +3, he no longer needs to make eye contact with the Conditioning subject to use any Dominate abilities, though giving orders through artificial or impersonal means (such as by phone) imposes a -5 penalty to that particular attempt.\n\nSubjects of Conditioning are oblivious to the process being inflicted upon them unless they also possess the power.The Storyteller may allow a victim or someone close to him a Wits + Occult roll to recognize that something is wrong. If the roll fails, the process may continue unaffected. If the roll succeeds, an effort may be made to interrupt the process. If the Conditioning vampire is particularly careful about how suggestions and messages are conveyed, the Wits + Occult roll might suffer a -1 penalty. Interrupting the process could mean fleeing the vampire or restraining the subject from meeting the vampire before all the required successes are accumulated.\n\nIt is possible, albeit extremely difficult, to break a subject’s Conditioning after the required successes are gathered. If the victim is isolated from her master for a number of weeks equal to twice the master’s current Conditioning-granted bonus, the bonus drops by one. For example, a subject has been Conditioned for a long time, and her master has achieved a bonus of +4 to Dominate her. If she is kept completely isolated from her master for eight weeks, the bonus drops to +3. Six more weeks, and it drops to +2, and so forth. The subject’s own personality and creativity slowly reawakens during this period, though she still experiences periods of listlessness, depression and desperation. For at least the first few weeks, the subject most likely makes every attempt to return to her master. Until the subject is completely free, it is horrifyingly easy for the vampire to reassert his dominance,as he likely has at least some bonus to Dominate the individual for a long while.\n\nIf the subject of Conditioning is also the thrall of the vampire, all successes on a Conditioning roll are doubled. So, if a vampire seeks to Condition his own ghoul, and he gets three successes to her two in one roll to program the subject, he actually accumulates six successes in that Conditioning session.\n\nIf this power is turned on a vampire with whom the user has a blood tie, a +2 bonus applies.', 4, 'Target brainwashing to make him a slave'),

Her mind now resides within the victim, and her own body falls into a torpor-like state, becoming indistinguishable from a true corpse.

Perhaps a careful search such as a pat-down or close examination reveals it, along with a Wits + Composure roll, successes from which must exceed those rolled for the activation of the power. As with all Obfuscate abilities, a character with Auspex might be able to see through Touch of Shadow (though he would still have to find the object normally if it were inside a pocket or otherwise physically concealed from view). Once the character does anything to draw attention to the object — such as deliberately showing it to someone or using it to attack or threaten — Touch of Shadow ends.

(“I glanced away for a moment, and when I looked back I think I saw him leave through that door.”) Some especially weak-willed mortals might simply forget the vampire was ever present at all. Kindred, of course, tend to be less strongly impacted, though even an experienced and knowledgeable vampire might find the experience somewhat startling.\n\nSuccessful use of Cloak of Night renders the character invisible until and unless he does something to draw attention (launching an attack, smashing a window, shouting a warning), in which case the cloak drops.\n\nHiding oneself with this power even accounts for a character inadvertently revealing himself.

Onlookers see the vampire for who she is.  \n **Dramatic Failure**: The character believes she is accepted differently, when in fact she is recognized as herself.\n\nNote that this power does not actually change the vampire’s true appearance. It merely convinces an onlooker that the Kindred is someone other than who he truly is by clouding the subject’s mind.\n\nIf faced with more than one observer, the character must choose one and hope the others expect to see the same person. Success in the contested action indicates that the character assumes the aspect of whomever the chosen subject most expects to see, and the others see that person as well, even if they have no knowledge of him or her. The character himself does not gain any knowledge of the individual, and might prove unable to maintain the deception for long.

While so interred, the character is immune to threat of harm from the sun’s rays, or to any physical attack as his corporeal form is actually merged with that of the substance itself. Some Gangrel rely on this ability while traveling from domain to domain, as its power gives them the ultimate freedom to do so.\n\n**Rank**: ••  \n **Action**: Instant  \n **Cost**: 1 Vitae  \n **Dice Pool**: No roll is necessary.

Whiling away the decades in a largely protected state, free from risk of detection or Final Death, is an attractive prospect. While such a character cannot be dug up, any significant disturbance to the area in which he resides alerts the vampire to the presence of intruders, though not necessarily to the details of their intrusion. If enough damage is done to the sleeping Kindred’s resting place, he returns immediately to corporeal form (and full wakefulness) in a shower of whatever substance he had taken for his haven.\n\nWhile in this state, the character’s consciousness hovers slightly above the torpor level (unless the vampire is both in torpor and in this state, in which case he is unaware), making perception of his surroundings distant at best. A player must succeed in a Humanity roll in order for his character to be aware of the presence of others in or around his place of rest (barring significant alteration to the vampire’s haven, of course, in which case he becomes aware automatically).\n\nSince the character is literally part of the earth, all attempts at locating him (via his scent, his aura or even through mystical methods of tracking) suffer a -3 penalty to their dice pools. Indeed, a searcher is likely to be confounded a bit even if he is successful. No attack can harm the interred vampire while he is in this state; a significant disruption of his surroundings can only cause him to resurface.\n\nWhen this power is first acquired, the character can meld his form only with natural earth or soil. If any other substance — including asphalt, wood or concrete — lies in the way between the vampire and natural ground, he cannot activate this power. (He must dig his way to natural soil or else find a way to stand thereupon.) With the expenditure of an additional three experience points, however, the vampire can select another natural substance from the following list: wood, water, natural stone or processed stone. “Processed stone” includes varieties of prepared surfacing materials such as concrete and asphalt. He can now meld into soil and this extra substance with equal ease. Thus, if his player spends 12 experience points, a vampire can rest in all five materials — virtually anywhere. Note that there must still be enough of a substance to accommodate the vampire’s form in roughly his natural Size. (A large tree trunk might suffice, but a small branch does not.)

A vampire can even sleep the day away in animal form, but must still avoid sunlight, which always affects vampires regardless of form. In addition, sleeping in animal form is taxing on the vampiric state, requiring the expenditure of an additional Vitae upon awakening.\n\nWhile in animal form, a vampire can use any Discipline in his repertoire except for Theban Sorcery, Crúac and Dominate (which becomes impossible when one tries to bark and yip commands). Each animal form conveys a separate host of benefits.\n\nAs a wolf, the vampire’s claws and teeth inflict lethal damage and add a +1 bonus to attack pools, Speed is doubled, and two bonus dice are added to any Wits + Composure rolls to be aware of events that happen in the wolf ’s environment.\n\nAs a bat, the vampire’s Strength becomes 1, but he can fly at a Speed of 20 (plus five more per dot of Vigor activated); three dice are added to all hearing-based rolls, and Defense increases by two.\n\n(At the player’s discretion, he may spend another Vitae and allow a character in wolf form or any other suitable form as described here to activate Claws of the Wild. As with normal uses of that power, these claws are obviously supernatural or otherwise remarkable, and even those unfamiliar with the world of the Damned will know that something is not quite right about the animal in question. A character who has assumed Shape of the Beast and also activates Claws of the Wild gains a +1 bonus to attack pools and inflicts aggravated damage instead of gaining a +1 bonus to attack pools and inflicting lethal damage with claw attacks.)\n\nWhen this power is first acquired, only bat or wolf form is available. With Storyteller permission, every three experience points spent allows a character access to the other form, or to an altogether different predatory animal, usually a mammal, although it’s rumored that Kindred in far-flung lands can assume the forms of predatory and scavenger birds.

As a small cloud of vapor, the character can float along above the ground at his normal Speed, slipping under doors and in between screens with ease. Although especially strong winds can divert him from his desired course for a time, not even gale-force winds can fully disperse his misty essence.\n\n**Rank**: •••••  \n **Action**: Instant  \n **Cost**: 1 Vitae  \n **Dice Pool**: This power involves no roll to invoke.

Roll Strength (plus any Vigor that the vampire activates). There’s no modifier for a light wind. A strong one imposes a -1 penalty, and a galeforce wind imposes a -3 penalty. A success allows the vampire to travel in any direction desired for the turn, even against the wind. An exceptional success allows him to travel in any direction for the remainder of the scene. A failure indicates that the vampire is pushed by the wind for one turn at the speed it travels. And a dramatic failure causes the vampire to blow out of control (but still as a cohesive whole) for the entire scene.\n\nWhile in mist form, the character is immune to all physical attacks, which merely pass through his gaseous body. Mystical attacks, however, still affect him normally, though mystical attacks that use mundane methods of delivery are similarly ineffective (such as claws or enchanted physical weapons). Even fire and sunlight inflict one less point of damage than normal. The trade-off, of course, is that a vampire in this state cannot physically attack anyone (not even another vampire using this power). Disciplines that do not require a body might still be effective, though. A vampire in gaseous form can use any Discipline he knows except for Theban Sorcery, Crúac and Dominate (which is useless when he has no eyes with which to make contact and no mouth with which to speak commands).\n\nA vampire in mist form cannot be “bottled” or otherwise trapped in part by someone trying to contain or disrupt his form. Bottling a portion of a vampire’s mist doesn’t cause him to resume human form without an arm, for example. A vampire’s entire mist form can be contained in a room or other large space that is airtight.

(37, NULL, 9, '**Action**: Instant  \n **Cost**: 1 Vitae per scene  \n **Dice Pool**: Resilience is unlike many other Disciplines in that it is not actively rolled. Rather, it provides an augmentation of physical potential that lasts for the scene in which it is activated, and which affects other rolls.\n\nEach dot of Resilience increases the character’s Stamina by one for the scene in which the Discipline is active. This bonus also increases the character’s Health dots during the scene. Resilience may not be invoked more than once per scene. That is, you may not spend a second Vitae and double the benefits of the power.\n\n> Example: Prince Maxwell is a Ventrue with Resilience 4 and Stamina 4. While returning to his haven, he encounters a resentful Kindred whom he snubbed at Elysium two nights before. Just to be sure, Maxwell activates his Resilience — his Stamina increases to 8 and his Health dots increase to 13 (Size 5 + Stamina 4 + Resilience 4).\n\nAdditionally, Resilience “downgrades” a number of aggravated damage points per scene equal to Resilience dots. This damage becomes lethal instead. Aggravated wounds suffered in excess of the character’s Resilience dots remain aggravated, however. This downgrade doesn’t apply to any aggravated wounds that the vampire already possesses, just to newly acquired ones suffered while Resilience is active. (In the preceding example, Maxwell would be able to downgrade no more than four points in total.)\n\n> Example: Maxwell is engaged in combat with a witch-hunter, who clubs him with a flaming torch. The torch inflicts five points of aggravated damage — but Maxwell’s Resilience of 4 downgrades that to four points of lethal damage, with one point of aggravated damage remaining.\n\nNote that the extra Health dots a character gains in a scene while Resilience is active can have consequences later. If a vampire suffers more damage than he has his usual Health dots, those excess wounds upgrade existing wounds (bashing becomes lethal, lethal becomes aggravated) as per the damage rules on p. 171-172 of the **World of Darkness Rulebook**. In other words, once the character’s Resilience “powers down” at the end of the scene and the extra Health dots that the power confers are lost, he might have to contend with more serious wounds than initially harmed him unless he heals them while Resilience is still active. See the “Temporary Health Dots” sidebar on p. 173 of the **World of Darkness Rulebook** to see what happens when extra Health is lost.\n\nAlso, if a character suffers damage that upgrades her Health chart, Resilience does not downgrade it. For example, if a character with seven Health dots and a single dot of Resilience suffers nine points of lethal damage, that ninth point stays aggravated.

This armor imposes a Defense penalty of -1, as it forces muscle to shift in order to maximize its effects.  \n **Exceptional Success:** The invocation summons the chosen weapon and its wielder ignores any and all Size/Strength penalties that would otherwise apply. When invoked for defense, it provides armor equal to Blood Potency against bashing and lethal damage with no Defense penalty.\n\nThis power may also be used multiple times, to create both an offensive weapon and a defensive form, either a shield or armor or both, but each use requires a separate expenditure of Vitae and an activation roll.

A vampire with a healthy supply of blood can attack, escape and even establish a Vinculum with sleeping victims by dripping a tiny bit of blood between their lips.

When swallowed by the Geheim who created it, the stone protects her against the predation of other Kindred and even the most virulent poisons of the world. When swallowed by another Kindred, the bezoar sets off a chain reaction that destroys much of his Vitae.\n\nThe process of creating the bezoar is somewhat complicated. First the Kindred must break down and analyze five points of her own Vitae via the Sanguine Analysis power above. She feeds the resultant mixture to a mammal (which can range in size from a large rat to a goat); the animal rarely wishes to consume the mixture, so Animalism is often necessary to force the matter. The animal dies during the course of the following day, and the Geheim can harvest the stone from its intestines when she awakes at sunset.\n\nA Geheim can possess a number of bezoars equal to her Blood Potency at any given time. Attempts to create further stones fail for reasons unknown. Bezoars last until consumed.\n\n**Cost:** 5 Vitae  \n **Dice Pool:** No roll is required.  \n **Action:** Special\n\nSo long as the character follows the appropriate steps, she successfully creates the bezoar. Of course, the steps may involve their own difficulties (such as convincing an animal to drink the putrid Vitae mixture). Once the bezoar has been made, it can be used in one of the four following manners (any of which destroys the stone):\n\n- The bezoar acts as a lesser philosopher’s stone. Utilizing it in any of the other procedures of Blut Alchemie grants a one-time bonus of +5. This applies to a single roll, even if the action is extended.\n- The bezoar protects the Kindred who created it from the fangs of other Kindred. By swallowing the bezoar, she temporarily transmutes her blood into a vile poison. Kindred who feed from the Geheim suffer one point of aggravated damage per Vitae taken. This generally induces the drinker to stop, but a Kindred in frenzy may destroy herself in an attempt to drain the Dilettante. The poisoned blood has no unusual effect on non-Kindred. Since Kindred blood quickly loses its potency after being removed from the Kindred, this cannot be used to create poisoned weapons. This protection lasts for a single scene.\n- The bezoar acts as an immediate remedy to the few poisons that can normally affect a vampire. If the Kindred consumes the bezoar during the same turn in which she is poisoned (doing so is an instant action, so long as the bezoar is on her person and she can reach it), she completely ignores the effect of the poison or venom. If consumed in a later turn, the bezoar instantly negates any further effect from the substance.\n- The bezoar interacts violently with the Vitae of other Kindred. If another Kindred consumes the bezoar, he immediately suffers a loss of Vitae equal to the Dilettante’s Blood Potency (at the time the stone was created). Each Vitae lost immediately inflicts one point of aggravated damage as it burns violently within the vampire’s body.

Powers that directly affect a character’s mind fall under Buttress the Soul, above, or Cleanse the Mind, below).

The Vinculum ensures a great deal of influence over any mortal or vampire a regnant has enthralled. Total mastery of Linagem allows a Telepath to refine that influence into a conduit for commanding his thralls. This power is unique in the sense that it does not provide functionality on its own. Knowledge of Animalism and/or Dominate is required to fully utilize this power’s benefits. Normally, a regnant may turn the powers of the Dominate discipline on his thrall without the need for eye contact. Distant Mastery allows the Telepath to issue such commands, as well as similar uses of the Animalism discipline, through Vinculum-forged spiritual connections similar to those of blood sympathy.\n\n**Cost:** 1 Willpower  \n **Dice Pool:** This power involves no roll. It allows the Telepath to follow up with an application of Animalism • or •• or Dominate • or ••.  \n **Action:** Reflexive. The Willpower point is spent in the same turn that the Corajoso uses either Animalism or Dominate. All rules, rolls and modifiers apply to the use of the follow-up power, as normal. Because Willpower is spent to activate Distant Mastery in the same turn as Animalism or Dominate, Willpower may not be spent to increase dice pools during that turn.\n\nThis power allows the Corajoso to use Animalism or Dominate on any animal, mortal or vampire that is fully blood bound to him. This can be accomplished at a range similar to the limits of blood sympathy’s link (within the same city or roughly 50 miles outside urban areas), but the range can be greatly extended. A Corajoso can use bound targets as “relay points,” measuring the distance from them rather than from himself.\n\nFor example, a Telepath has a ghoul living roughly 50 miles away, and another living 100 miles away. The vampire can send a message to the more distant target using the blood of the intermediary as a relay. This inflicts a point of bashing damage upon all intermediary targets, and costs the vampire one Vitae for each intermediary he uses.

Finally, Silent Passage also hides evidence of the vampire’s passing. He does not leave tracks in the sand, break the grass as he walks through, or disturb the surface of water as he is walking or swimming. In the case of traveling through water, the character may move no faster than his normal walking speed. Moving any faster will disrupt this power and cause it to fail.

The plant may be either dead or alive, but it cannot be worked into any other form. While he is melded with the plant, the character’s senses are extended from the plant, providing a full 360 degree range of sight, hearing, touch, etc. These senses extend throughout the entire plant. For example, if he melds with a tree that is taller than a nearby wall, he would be able to see over the wall from the vantage point of the tree’s taller branches.

Vitae plays a very important role in the use of Crúac — it literally calls upon the power inherent in the Blood to fuel supernatural effects. Use of Crúac requires that the Vitae be “spent” in a visible or otherwise significant manner. For example, when a Vitae is spent for a character to activate a ritual, he likely has to cut himself with a dagger and bleed on the ground, activating the magic with the spilled Vitae (or through some other direct appeal to the power of the Blood).\n\nCrúac does not have the same linear progression that other Disciplines do. A character’s mastery dictates the highest level of rituals that he may learn. **Rituals are bought with experience points**. For example, a character with two dots of Crúac can know an unlimited number of level-one and level-two rituals (provided the experience points to learn each of them are paid). He may not learn any level-three Crúac rituals until his Crúac dots increase to 3. **Each time a character acquires a dot of Crúac (including at character creation), he gains a ritual of that level at no additional cost**.\n\nCrúac is insidious. It demands a certain degree of subservience and even cruelty from its practitioners, possibly in deference to the dire old gods from whence the Discipline is rumored to come.

If a character increases his Crúac score higher than his Humanity would normally allow, his Humanity immediately drops to the appropriate level and the player makes a Humanity roll to see if the character acquires a derangement in the process of heightening his occult knowledge. (See p. 182-188 for more on Humanity rolls and derangements.)\n\n**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Occult + Crúac. Because of its sanguinary nature, Crúac doubles any bonuses that a vampire’s blood ties might apply, such as in a ritual performed on a sire, grandsire, childe or grandchilde. Also, the Nosferatu clan weakness does not apply to the Discipline user’s roll.\n\n**Action:** Extended. The number of successes required to activate a ritual is equal to the level of the ritual (so a level-three ritual requires three successes to enact). Each roll represents one turn of ritual casting. Note also that each point of damage suffered in a turn is a penalty to the next casting roll made for the character, in addition to any wound penalties that a caster might suffer.\n\nCosts to activate Crúac rituals must be paid before the roll can be made. Normally this isn’t an issue, as a ritual that costs one Vitae can have its activation roll made in the same turn (as spending Vitae is a reflexive action). In some cases, though, a ritual costs more Vitae than the caster can spend in a single turn. In cases like these, the caster’s player makes the roll on the turn he (reflexively) spends the last Vitae necessary to invoke the ritual.\n\nIf a character fails to complete the ritual in time (such as by being killed before accumulating enough successes) or decides to cancel the ritual before garnering enough successes to activate it, the effect simply fails. Any Vitae expenditures made are not recovered, however.\n\n**Roll Results**  \n **Dramatic Failure:** The ritual fails spectacularly, inflicting some aspect of itself as a detrimental effect upon the caster. A ritual intended to damage a subject inflicts its damage upon the caster, for example, while a ritual designed to plague its victim with pangs of hunger visits its effects upon the caster.  \n **Failure:** The ritual fails entirely, but not dangerously. Vitae is consumed as normal, but the ritual has no effect.  \n **Success:** The ritual takes place as described.  \n **Exceptional Success:** The ritual takes place as described. In many cases, extra successes are their own reward, causing additional damage or conferring extra duration, capacity or similar benefits.

This penalty is cumulative with multiple distractions (such as by casting a ritual in combat during a hurricane).

With a scalpel, the character opens up the breastbone of a dead or comatose human and pulls the slithery, still-screaming object out. If the owner wasn’t dead, he soon will be. Residents of the Moulding Room with this power keep libraries of “souls,” preserved in formaldehyde.\n\nWhen the time comes, they transplant these “souls” into other mortals, or consume them, in order to gain moral strength.\n\n**Cost:** One Willpower to remove or transplant  \n **Dice Pool:** Intelligence + Medicine + Detournement to transplant or remove;  \n Stamina + Composure + Detournement to consume a “soul.”  \n **Action:** Extended to remove or transplant; five successes required to remove; another five to transplant. Each roll represents two hours of work. Consuming an already stored “soul” is an instant action.\n\nThe “souls” have their own unique characteristics. For example, the consistency and activity of the organ gives some sign as to the character of the individual. If it is firm, smooth-textured and moves strongly, its owner was someone of high moral character. If it’s flaccid and barely moving at all, it belonged to someone weak or evil.\n\nThe “soul” organ can be transplanted into another human body, replacing the implantee’s “soul.” The recipient of the transplant replaces his own Morality Rating with the rating of the previous owner of the “soul,” along with any derangements gained through degeneration (which, again, replace any derangements he might have). A journalist with a Morality of 6, for example, falls into the clutches of a Resident of the Moulding Room. The Resident drugs and performs surgery on the journalist, replacing his “soul” with that of a professional killer (Morality 2).

But later on he discovers that his conscience doesn’t bother him at all when he starts behaving callously towards the people he writes about and, later, brutally towards his girlfriend... and he starts hearing voices.\n\nThe vampire can also use the “soul” for his own purposes: eating it – and if he has this power, he can eat it – grants him an extra Willpower dot for the rest of the night. He can’t spend the dot on any power that requires the permanent expenditure of a dot of Willpower (such as creating a childe or joining a bloodline), but he can benefit from the extra points of Willpower the “soul” provides and the advantage of having a bigger maximum Willpower pool.

It invokes the soul of the Kindred who performs a ritual. **Willpower spent in this manner does not add three dice to activation rolls**. Indeed, because one may spend only one Willpower point per turn, a Willpower point may never be spent to augment Theban Sorcery rolls unless specified otherwise. Willpower merely makes the magic possible.\n\nAdditionally, **Theban Sorcery rituals require certain items to be used or consumed to activate the powers**. These components are known as offerings. Practitioners believe these items are offered in sacrifice to God, Longinus or to whomever provides the actual manifestation of the power. Attempts to invoke Theban Sorcery without suitable offerings fail outright. Offerings are consumed upon the invocation of a ritual, leaving behind nothing but a handful of ash.\n\nLike Crúac, Theban Sorcery does not have the same linear progression that other Disciplines do. A character’s mastery dictates the highest level of rituals that he may learn. Rituals are bought with experience points. For example, a character with two dots of Theban Sorcery can know an unlimited number of level-one and level-two rituals (provided the experience points are paid to learn each), but he may not learn any level-three Theban Sorcery rituals until his base Theban Sorcery dots are increased to 3. **Each time a character acquires a dot of Theban Sorcery (including at character creation), he gains a ritual of that level at no additional cost**. More rituals may be acquired with experience points. Other Vampire books offer Theban Sorcery rituals, and players and Storytellers are encouraged to create their own using those presented here as models.\n\n**Dice Pool:** Intelligence + Academics + Theban Sorcery.  \n Unlike Crúac and its relationship to the Nosferatu, the Gangrel clan weakness does apply to the Discipline user’s roll on attempts to invoke Theban Sorcery rituals.  \n **Action:** Extended. The number of successes required to activate a ritual is equal to the level of the ritual (so a level-three ritual requires three successes to enact). Each roll represents one turn of ritual casting. Note also that each point of damage incurred in a turn is a penalty to the next casting roll made for the character, in addition to any wound penalties suffered. If a character fails to complete the ritual in time (such as by being sent into torpor before accumulating enough successes) or decides to cancel the ritual before garnering enough successes to activate it, the effect simply fails. Any Willpower expenditures made are not recovered, however, and offerings are still burned to ash.\n\n**Roll Results**  \n **Dramatic Failure:** The ritual fails spectacularly, inflicting some aspect of itself as a detrimental effect upon the caster. A ritual intended to damage a subject inflicts its damage upon the caster, for example, while a ritual designed to store Vitae in an object depletes the caster of some amount of his own.  \n **Failure:** The ritual fails entirely, but not dangerously. Willpower and offerings are consumed as normal, but the ritual has no effect.  \n **Success:** The ritual takes place as described.  \n **Exceptional Success:** The ritual takes place as described.

Zombies are unfailing, devoted slaves. What they lack in intelligence and motivation, they more than make up for in dogged determination and sheer, tireless pursuit of the tasks to which they are set.\n\nGenerally speaking, such zombies possess a level of reasoning just above that of a rather intelligent dog, and lack even that dog’s ability to predict the future or make independent decisions. They understand certain visual cues (such as the opening of the door they are meant to guard) and auditory commands (“Defend me!”), but cannot perform feats requiring abstract intellect. They have a limited memory, but cannot make even basic correlations or inferences. (While they can, for example, dimly recall that their master has changed their clothes once a day, they cannot determine that he is likely to do so again tomorrow.)\n\nThey have no individual initiative. These corpse-slaves are not really any stronger than they were in life, but they are tireless and completely without the ability to sense or respond to pain. They need not eat or sleep, and will do whatever chore they are set to until told otherwise, even if it requires them to tear their own bodies apart in the attempt. They experience neither fear nor the desire for self-preservation and have no minds, per se, for others to control.\n\nEach zombi created by this ritual has the following base traits:\n\n**Attributes:** Power 1, Finesse 1, Resistance 2  \n **Size:** 5 (or less if the corpse is small)  \n **Speed:** 1\\*  \n **Initiative:** 1\\*  \n **Defense:** 1\\*\n\n\\* These traits begin at 1, regardless of Attribute scores. The character can spend Vitae to make a zombie stronger, however. For each Vitae spent (in additional to the point required to activate the ritual), the player can raise any one trait by two, or any two traits by one. There is no limit to the amount of Vitae a vampire can use to empower a zombi (up to the limits of his blood pool, obviously), but once the character stops spending blood to do so, thus completing the ritual, he cannot further empower that zombi.\n\nZombies do not suffer wound penalties and cannot heal damage naturally. Bashing, lethal and aggravated wounds are marked normally, but zombies never suffer incapacitation — they just keep going until their last Health point is lost to aggravated damage. When a zombie’s final (rightmost) Health box is marked with bashing damage, no roll is required to remain conscious. When its final Health box is marked with lethal damage, it does not collapse and begin bleeding to death — it keeps going. Any damage suffered after that is upgraded to aggravated. Once this happens, the corpse loses body parts with each new upgraded wound until it is completely pulverized or disintegrated (the Storyteller decides which parts fall off with each wound).\n\nA zombi continues to rot. It suffers one lethal point of damage with each passage of a number of nights equal to its Resistance. A zombi with a Resistance of 3 therefore suffers one lethal point of rotting damage every three nights.\n\nIn addition, zombies created by this ritual have a vulnerability to salt. If a zombi “tastes” salt, it is destroyed instantly.\n\nOtherwise, zombies can only be destroyed when their final Health box is marked with aggravated damage.', 3, 'Create a mindless zombi'),
(153, 'Return to Dust (Ghede)', 33, '**only available to patrons of Ghede**\n\nKindred can call upon Ghede to pull the soul of a slain vampire back into the dust of his remains for a limited time. An impression of the face of the dead vampire appears in the dust, answering the houngan’s questions in a soft, dry whisper. The ritualist can ask one question of the ghost per level in Vodoun. After it has answered, it departs. (The houngan cannot delay for more than five turns between questions, or else the ghost disappears prematurely.) The ghost’s answers are not necessarily truthful or straightforward, as the ritual in no way forces the ghost to be honest. This ritual cannot be used to call up the soul of a diablerized vampire.\n\n**Suggested Modifiers**  \n **Modifier - Situation**  \n +2 - The ritualist is well acquainted with the deceased.  \n +2 - The deceased is connected to the ritualist through a blood tie.  \n -2 - The deceased disliked the ritualist.', 4, 'Ask question to the soul of a dead vampire through their ashes.

(154, 'Cheat Death (Ghede)', 33, '**only available to patrons of Ghede**\n\nGhede is Lord of the Dead and keeper of the eternal gateways between life and death, and as such, he has final say over who dies and who lives. A houngan of Ghede may call upon his patron loa to shield him from Final Death. A houngan who performs the ritual Cheat Death is protected by Ghede from Final Death for one hour after the ritual is performed. No matter how hard his foe may try, the houngan simply will not die when under the protection of his patron loa.\n\nCheat Death may only be performed once a night. After the initial ritual is completed, a houngan can activate the effects of Cheat Death as an instant action at any time within the course of a night. When the effects of Cheat Death have been successfully activated, the vampire is under the protection of the ritual for one hour.\n\nThe rightmost Health box cannot be filled with any kind of damage while a character is protected by Cheat Death. If the vampire enters frenzy, however, the ritual is dissolved, and the character may be killed. Wound penalties apply normally to a character protected by this ritual.', 5, 'Prevent the caster from dying due to damage for one hour; cancelled if the caster enter frenzy'),
(155, 'Spiritual Intermediary', 33, 'Papa Legba can be called upon to grant the ritualist the ability to see, hear and speak with spirits. Kindred granted this ability can also detect their unseen presence if they are hiding or have chosen to not reveal themselves.

The effects of the ritual last for one hour per dot of Rapport.', 1, 'Allow communication with spirits in the Twilight'),
(156, 'Universal Translator', 33, 'A vodouisant may call upon Papa Legba to translate any language, verbal or written, allowing communication and understanding across cultural and knowledge barriers. When Universal Translator is in effect, the vampire understands all languages and can speak or write any language that he chooses to focus upon. Fundamentally, Universal Translator is based upon pattern recognition. Therefore, it may also be used on computer and programming languages, allowing the vampire to understand and write the language of code. Universal Translator remains in effect for one scene.', 2, 'Allow communication and understanding of any language'),
(157, 'Legba’s Curse (Legba)', 33, '**only available to patrons of Papa Legba**\n\nIn linguistics, the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis states that there is a systematic relationship between language and how a person both understands the world and behaves in it. It is language that defines the world. Without language, a person cannot think or communicate, he can only perceive.\n\nA houngan of Legba may temporarily remove a person, place or thing from the mind of a victim, rendering the subject incapable of talking about, understanding, or even thinking about the removed noun. The victim may still perceive the object if confronted with it outright, and he may even understand its fundamental properties individually, but he cannot group those properties together to fully grasp or describe what the object is. For example, a victim is made to forget the word “apple.” If he is subsequently confronted with an apple, he sees that it is round. Then he sees that it is red, but he cannot recall or see that it is also round. Then he feels that it is smooth, but he cannot recall or see that it is also round and red, and so on. The victim need not be present for the ritual, but the houngan must know his name, or possess an object connected to the victim (hair, an article of clothing, etc.). If the ritual is successful, the devotee chooses any single noun (including proper nouns), which is then removed from the victim’s mind for a number of days equal to the houngan’s level of Rapport.', 4, 'Remove a person, place or thing from the mind of a victim'),
(158, 'Leech Understanding (Legba)', 33, '**only available to patrons of Papa Legba**\n\nA houngan of Legba may perform the ritual Leech Understanding upon a restrained or incapacitated vampire. The ritualist lays his hands upon the vampire, and knowledge pours into him from the mind of the victim. A character who performs Leech Understanding permanently gains an additional dot in a random Skill that the victim possesses at a higher level than the houngan, and the victim permanently loses a dot in that Skill. If the victim does not possess any Skills at a higher level than the houngan, the ritual has no effect. The Skill dot gained need not be paid for with experience points. Leech Understanding may not be used on mortals.\n\nUsing this ritual causes a degeneration check for vampires with Humanity 4 (roll three dice).', 4, 'Steal dots in a random Skill from a vampire'),
(159, 'Create Gris-Gris (Legba)', 33, '**only available to patrons of Papa Legba**\n\nKindred under the patronage of Papa Legba can call upon him to trap a spirit within a gris-gris, a talisman that houses a spirit and grants the wearer certain abilities or protection. Gris-gris are typically small, cloth bags containing herbs, oils, stones, small bones, hair and nails, pieces of cloth soaked with Vitae, or other small items that calm the trapped spirit and connect it with the owner of the talisman.\n\nBefore the houngan calls upon Papa Legba, he must first make the amulet that will house the spirit. Creating a gris-gris requires an extended Dexterity + Crafts roll with a target number of 10. Each roll is equal to five minutes.\n\nOnce the talisman has been created, the houngan performs the ritual to call upon Papa Legba. If the ritual is successful, Papa Legba will trap a spirit within the talisman. The type of spirit and Rank of the spirit trapped is determined by what the houngan wants the gris-gris to do. A gris-gris that can be used to provide light might require a fire-spirit of low (1-2) Rank, while a talisman that can grant the user the ability to cause foes to burst into flame requires trapping a fire-spirit of high Rank (3 or more).\n\nThe ritual that traps a spirit within a gris-gris is contested, pitting the ritualist’s Presence + Persuasion + Rapport against the spirit’s Rank + Resistance.\n\nVampires creating gris-gris are wise to tread carefully. Spirits do not usually wish to remain trapped within a gris-gris, forced to serve a houngan. Many attempt to break free, and if they are able, may turn upon the houngan who imprisoned and enslaved them. For this reason, it is very difficult, and dangerous, to trap a powerful spirit within a gris-gris. While potent spirits offer greater abilities to the houngan, they are also extremely difficult to contain and are dangerous (and sometimes deadly) when emancipated.\n\nIf the gris-gris is destroyed, the trapped spirit is freed and the devotee no longer enjoys the benefits the talis- man provided.\n\nThe spirit releases its Numina only upon the talisman’s activation. The user must request or command the spirit to act whenever he seeks its power. This is done nonverbally with an instant action Wits + Persuasion + Rapport roll. Success allows the vampire to use the talisman for the following scene.\n\nEach time the talisman is activated, the trapped spirit has a chance to escape. The spirit contests the houngan’s Wits + Persuasion + Rapport roll with its Resistance. If the spirit breaks free of its prison, the gris-gris becomes useless. Lesser spirits return to Twilight or the Shadow, while more powerful spirits may choose to attack the houngan.', 5, 'trap a spirit within a gris-gris that can be activated to use its power'),
(160, 'Kalfou’s Misfortune', 33, 'Kalfou may be called upon to inflict a curse intended to bring about immediate ill-fortune upon another. The target of the curse need not be present to be affected by Kalfou’s Misfortune, but the devotee must have met the target. Success causes a number of dice to be removed from the subject’s dice pool. One die is subtracted per Rapport dot the ritualist possesses (an additional die is subtracted if Kalfou is the patron loa of the ritualist). Kalfou’s Misfortune lasts an hour per dot of Rapport the ritualist possesses.\n\nThis ritual involves a contested action, pitting the ritualist’s Presence + Persuasion + Rapport against the subject’s Resolve + Blood Potency. Resisting Kalfou’s Misfortune is a reflexive action. Kalfou’s Misfortune can be used a number of times per night equal to the ritualist’s Rapport.\n\n**Suggested Modifiers**  \n **Modifier - Situation**  \n +1 - The ritualist has a physical object connected to the target of the curse (e.g. hair, clothing, a photograph).  \n +2 - The ritualist is well acquainted with the subject.  \n +2 - The subject is connected to the ritualist through a blood tie.', 1, 'Remove dices from a target dice pools for hours'),

Only one of the vampires involved needs to be able to cast the ritual. Each vampire making an oath under Kalfou signifies her promise with a drop of her own blood upon a swatch of white linen.\n\nA promise sworn beneath the watchful gaze of Kalfou can only be broken at a great price. If a vampire knowingly and willingly acts in any way contrary to an oath sworn beneath Kalfou, the loa curses him with bad luck, and the oath-breaker receives a -5 penalty to all actions until his promise has been fulfilled, he dies, or the oath is lifted.\n\nThe oath is only lifted if the binding cloth on which the oath-takers’ blood was shared is destroyed.', 2, 'Curse oathbreakers with a strong penalty, until promise is fullfilled, they die or  oath is lifter by destroying the focus'),
(162, 'Ill Omen (Kalfou)', 33, '**only available to patrons of Kalfou**\n\nA mambo of Kalfou may call upon the loa to inflict a horrifying nightmare upon a foe. The focal point of the nightmare may be a person, place or object. Whatever the subject of the nightmare is, the victim wakes with an intense phobia of it. The Kindred attempts to avoid that person, place or object as though their very existence depended upon it. If the victim is somehow confronted with the object of his nightmare, he will react with utter horror. Each turn the victim remains within 10 feet of the object, the player rolls Resolve + Composure – the mambo’s Blood Potency. If the roll fails, the victim immediately flees from the object in terror. If escape is not possible, he enters Rötschreck. If the victim is mortal and is unable to escape, he immediately faints, and remains unconscious for an hour or until forcibly roused, whichever comes first.\n\nIt should be noted that although the victim wholly and irrationally believes that the object of his fear will harm him, it is, in fact, no more dangerous than it would be under normal circumstances.\n\nIll Omen remains in effect for a number of nights equal to the mambo’s Rapport.', 3, 'Inflict phobia for nights on a victim'),
(163, 'Curse Object (Kalfou)', 33, '**only available to patrons of Kalfou**\n\nKindred under the patronage of Kalfou may perform a ritual to tie bad fortune to existing lifeless objects (jewelry, clothing, a weapon, etc.).\n\nIf the ritual is successful, the targeted object is cursed. A character who comes into physical contact with the object must remove a number of dice from her dice pool for any action subsequently performed. One die is subtracted per Rapport dot the ritualist possessed at the time of the item’s creation.\n\nThe subject need not remain in contact with the item to be affected by its curse. Simply brushing again the cursed object brings bad luck upon the individual. The curse is automatically contested by the victim upon touch, pitting the ritualist’s Presence + Persuasion + Rapport against the subject’s Resolve + Blood Potency. If the victim fails the roll, he is cursed for a number of hours equal to the houngan’s dots in Rapport.', 4, 'Curse an object, inflicting a penalty on dice pools to anyone touching it'),
(164, 'Vodoun Doll (Kalfou)', 33, '**only available to patrons of Kalfou**\n\nMade popular through horror films and tales whispered around the fire, the Vodoun Doll is probably one of the most iconic items associated with the practice of Vodoun. As it relates to Vodoun practiced by Kindred, a Vodoun Doll (or poppet) is a potent magical tool used by the most beloved houngan of Kalfou. A vampire may stick a wooden nail into a fabricated doll, and in doing so, manipulate his enemies from afar or inflict any number of dark and powerful curses upon them.\n\nVodoun dolls can be constructed from almost any material: cloth, wrapped twine, clay, wax or corn husks. Creating a voodoo doll requires an extended Dexterity + Crafts roll with a target number of 10. Each roll is equal to five minutes. The houngan must have a piece of the target or something very important to him — a drop of blood, a lock of hair, or an item of great personal worth such as a wedding ring or a piece of a favorite garment. Alternately, the ritual can be performed using a simple photograph or an object that the target has touched within the last week, but either of these imposes a -2 modifier on the ritual’s activation roll.\n\nOnce the doll has been created, the houngan performs the ritual to call upon Kalfou. If the ritual is successful, Kalfou creates a sympathetic connection to the intended target. The doll retains the link to the living individual for five hours. If the Vodoun doll is destroyed, all the sympathetic control is broken and the target is freed from all effects.\n\nOnce the doll is connected to its target, the houngan can puncture it with a single wooden nail. Only one nail may be used at a time (multiple pins may not be used to simultaneously affect different areas), but the nail may be removed and the doll punctured again in another location to achieve a different effect as often as the houngan likes.\n\nPlacement of the nail, pushed into the Vodoun doll, affects the target in a variety of ways:\n\n**Pin Placement: Heart**  \n The target is “staked,” a nail in the heart of the Vodoun doll renders the foe paralyzed until the nail is removed. Used against a mortal, a nail in the heart reduces the target’s Stamina to 0 for purposes of deter mining Health and all dice pools involving endurance or fatigue.  \n **Pin Placement: Eye**  \n The target is rendered blind until the nail is removed.  \n **Pin Placement: Ear**  \n The target is rendered deaf until the nail is removed.  \n **Pin Placement: Mouth**  \n The target is rendered mute until the nail is removed.  \n **Pin Placement: Forehead**  \n The target is cursed with bad luck while the wooden nail remains in the Vodoun doll’s forehead. When the target attempts to perform a task that requires significant thought (any action that makes use of a Mental Skill or Attribute), the target’s player loses one die per dot of the houngan’s Blood Potency.  \n **Pin Placement: Stomach**  \n The target feels ill, and becomes violently sick if he attempts to consume blood while the nail remains in the poppet’s stomach. He does not vomit the Vitae currently in his system, but cannot feed to gain additional Vitae until the pin is removed. If the Subject is mortal, he may not eat or drink until the nail is removed.  \n **Pin Placement: Extremities**  \n The target is cursed with bad luck while the wooden nail remains in the Vodoun doll’s hand or foot. When the target attempts to perform a task that requires significant physical prowess (any action that makes use of a Physical Skill or Attribute), the target’s player loses one die per dot of the houngan’s Blood Potency.', 5, 'Stick a wooden nail into a fabricated doll, inflicting any number of dark and powerful curses upon the victim'),
(165, 'Tapas, Rituals of Penance', 25, '**Ritual of of the Kinnaree**\n\nThroughout the stories of the Thai people, devotees of the Devi would perform rituals of sacrifice in the hopes of receiving blessings from their patrons. Rather than one specific ritual, the Tapas are a suite of rituals used to grant the penitent bonuses to certain dice pools depending on which spirit receives the sacrifice. The bonus lasts for one scene, but each one must be purchased as a separate ritual to a different member of the pantheon; three examples are listed below.\n\n**Tapas to Ma Durga:** Calling out to the destroyer of demons, a petitioner must make an offering of the precious blood from her own tongue without showing signs of pain or suffering. This does not cause any damage, but requires a Resolve + Composure roll to resist a display of pain (add any dots in the Iron Stamina Merit to this pool). On successful activation of the ritual, Ma Durga grants the penitent two dice to any Weaponry roll that pertains to swords, Durga’s preferred weapon.\n\n**Tapas to Brahma:** Like Shurpanakha’s wicked brother, a petitioner calls out to Shiva and stands on one foot for a full turn. Upon successful activation of the ritual, the penitent is gifted with a bonus of two dice to Politics rolls, or three dice for Politics rolls involving conquest or political domination.\n\n**Tapas to Hannuman:** The King of the Monkeys was a great friend of Lord Rama, and a master of beasts. A penitent seeking Hannuman’s boon must symbolically break the neck of a hog or boar; this can be as simple as drawing a picture of the animal and tearing the paper in half. Upon successful activation of the ritual, the penitent receives a bonus of two dice to all Animal Ken rolls for a scene.', 1, 'Bonuses to certain dice pools depending on which spirit receives the sacrifice'),
(166, 'Gora Mukhi', 25, '**Ritual of of the Kinnaree**\n\nIn the Ramakien, Shurpanakha used her demonic magic in order to transform herself into a beautiful maiden so that she might seduce Lord Rama. The Kinnaree say that the story is backwards. They claim that the lovely virgin with her long nails used blood magic to transform her child-like form into that of a potbellied, cross-eyed monster of a hag. Using this horrible visage, she terrified Lord Rama so he would be more apt to war against her brother Ravan. By smearing their lovely young skin with blood and the waste of animals, the Kinnaree becomes hideous and terrible. Modern Acolytes have found that they can perform the ritual without the excrement, but traditionalists scoff at the deviation.\n\nSuccessfully enacting the ritual costs the ritualist her ability to use Socialize or Persuasion on mortals for the remainder of the night, but in exchange, she gains her level of Crúac as a bonus to Intimidation rolls. Any aggressors against the Kinnaree suffer an Initiative penalty equal to the caster’s Crúac as well. The character can also, by spending an additional point of Vitae, extend her fingernails out into wicked-looking curved claws. These claws inflict 1L damage in combat, but on a dramatic failure they snap, causing a point of lethal damage to the Kinnarree.', 2, 'Cannot use Socialize or Persuasion on mortals; gain bonus to Intimidation; inflict Initiative penalty; grow curved claws');

Each maneuver is a prerequisite for the next. So, your character can’t have “Deflect and Thrust” until he has “Whirling Blades.” The maneuvers and their effects are detailed below, all of which are based on the Weaponry Skill.\n\n**Whirling Blades (•):** Your character’s Dodge trait (Defense doubled; see p. 156) is not penalized by multiple attacks staged against him in a turn until the number of attacks exceeds his Weaponry dots, at which point each attack thereafter reduces his Dodge by -1.

Each acquisition of this Merit is dedicated to one type of ally, whether in an organization, society or circle. Examples include the police, City Hall, criminals, unions, banks, university faculty and hospital staff. In order to have alliances in more than one venue, you need to purchase this Merit multiple times, each trait with its own dots.\n\nThus, your character might have Allies (Police) ••, Allies (Criminals) ••• and Allies (City Hall) •, each acquired separately at character creation or during play. Each dot that your character has indicates how deep his influence runs in that group. One dot might mean he can ask for minor favors, such as being spared a parking ticket if alliance is among police, or being allowed to see an article before it goes to press if alliance is among reporters. Three dots garner considerable favors, such as a building permit “going missing” at City Hall, or a strike resolution being wrapped up early among union leaders. Five dots allow for dangerous and even overtly criminal favors, such as a stock being sabotaged on Wall Street or the answers to an exam being shared by a university professor.\n\nThe kinds of requests made of people in an organization typically have to relate to their sphere of influence. Asking a criminal to slow down the bureaucratic process at City Hall makes no sense, but asking him to pass along word of a drug buy does. Favors might be minor and within the bounds of a person’s job or role, such as processing some paperwork more quickly than usual, or could be significant or dangerous and outside what’s allowed or even legal, such as allowing a civilian access to the police evidence locker.\n\nThe Storyteller has final say over what is an acceptable request and what is not. If there’s any doubt, the Storyteller could call for a Manipulation + Persuasion roll, with a bonus equal to your character’s Allies dots. Penalties might also apply based on the importance or danger of the request. Asking someone to do something already in the bounds of their role imposes no modifier, while asking them to do something that could get them suspended imposes a -3 penalty, and asking for something that could get them jailed or killed is -5. Frequent favors asked of the same group also imposes a penalty as group members grow tired of being called upon.\n\nSimilarly, a roll of Manipulation + Persuasion + Allies dots could determine how many police answer your character’s call for help, or how many longshoremen turn up when your character needs a show of force (one per success rolled).\n\nAllies doesn’t have to be defined in terms of specific individuals over whom your character has sway.

Contacts can include individuals whom you or the Storyteller defines, but more likely they comprise an array of people from whom your character can draw information with a phone call, email or face-to-face query. Contacts is strictly information-gathering. Contacts do not come perform services for your character or rush to his aid. Those actions are the purview of other Merits such as Allies and Retainer.\n\nGaining information from contacts requires a successful Manipulation + Persuasion or Socialize roll, depending on the relationship between your character and the people in question.

(42, 'Haven', 'social', 0, 1, 1, 5, 0, 0, 'A haven is a place where a vampire sleeps, protected from the sun during the deadly daylight hours. Legends tell of vampires in dark, twisted citadels on high mountain peaks, complete with labyrinthine catacombs, but the reality is far less grandiose. In truth, a haven can be as simple as a sewer or an abandoned warehouse or a crate in a forgotten storage closet, as long as it is undisturbed between dawn and dusk.\r\n\r\nAll havens are not created equal. A warehouse might have plenty of space and proximity to a significant amount of prey, but it might not be secure against unwanted visitors. An abandoned subway car in a long-forgotten tunnel has space and adequate security, but it might be so far out of the way that finding prey is difficult. Great time and effort is spent finding suitable havens, and their value is represented by three factors — location, size and security. Players who choose this Merit must also choose how to allocate these three factors when spending points. For instance, two points may be spent on Haven Location, with a third spent on Haven Security.\r\n\r\nA good Haven Location makes it easier for a vampire to feed, situated near a meeting place for large numbers of humans. A haven with many dots in this category might be close to several nightclubs or bars that do considerable nighttime business, while one with few dots might simply be close to a bus or train station that brings travelers on a regular basis. Each dot of Haven Location grants a +1 die bonus on hunting checks for the character who controls it and any whom she allows in. Havens without any dots in Location are sufficiently secluded so as to not provide any bonus. Haven Size is important to characters who need a place to safely store their possessions and valuables. A haven with no dots in Haven Size is just large enough for its owner and perhaps a single companion, with minimal if any storage capacity — the aforementioned crate in the forgotten storage closet, or a cramped apartment. By spending points to increase a haven’s size, a player allows for accoutrements and personal effects. Larger havens can be anything from mansions to mountain hideaways to vast subterranean catacombs. Note, however, that havens of considerable size are not necessarily easy to maintain.\r\n\r\n• A small apartment or underground chamber; 1-2 rooms\\\r\n•• A large apartment or small family home; 3-4 rooms\\\r\n••• A warehouse, church or large home; 5-8 rooms, or large enclosure\\\r\n•••• A abandoned mansion or network of subway tunnels; equivalent of 9-15 rooms or chambers\\\r\n••••• A sprawling estate or vast network of tunnels; countless rooms or chambers\\\r\n\r\nOf course, Haven Location and Haven Size do not prevent rival vampires from attempting to find and steal choice havens, nor do they prevent intrusion by mortals (police, criminal organizations, social workers). Players of characters who wish to ensure privacy and safety may choose to spend points on Haven Security, thus making it difficult for others to gain entrance. Havens with no dots in Haven Security can be found by those intent enough to look, and offer little protection once they have been breached. Each dot of Haven Security subtracts one die from efforts to intrude into the haven by anyone a character doesn’t specifically allow in. This increased difficulty may be because the entrance is so difficult to locate (behind a bookcase, under a carpet) or simply difficult to penetrate (behind a vault door). Also, each dot of Haven Security offers a +1 bonus on Initiative for those inside against anyone attempting to gain entrance (good sight lines, video surveillance).\r\n\r\nCharacters whose players spend no points at all on Haven might have their own small, humble havens, or perhaps they share the haven of a sire or Prince. In any event, they simply do not gain the mechanical benefits of those who have spent Merit points improving the quality of their homes. Each aspect of the Haven Merit has a limit of 5. In other words, Haven Location, Haven Size and Haven Security may not rise above 5 (to a maximum of 15 points spent on this Merit).\r\n\r\nSpecial: It’s possible for the Haven Merit to be shared among characters in a close-knit group. They might simply be devoted to one another and willing to pool what they have, or perhaps their mutual reliance on an individual or trust could bring them together to share what they have in common. To share this Merit, two or more characters simply have to be willing to pool their dots for greater capability. A shared rating in the Haven Merit cannot rise higher than five dots in any of the three aspects of the trait. That is, characters cannot pool more than five points to be devoted to, say, Haven Size. If they wish to devote extra points to the Merit, they must allocate those dots to a different aspect of the Merit, such as Location or Security.\r\n\r\nShared Haven dots can be lost. Coterie members or associates might be abused or mistreated, ending relationships. Group members might perform actions that cast themselves (and the group) in a bad light. Money might be spent or lost. If any group member does something to diminish the haven, its dots decrease for all group members. That’s the weakness of sharing dots in this Merit. The chain is only as strong as its weakest link. The Storyteller dictates when character actions or events in a story compromise shared Haven dots.\r\n\r\nCharacters can also leave a shared haven. A rift might form between close Kindred. A character might meet Final Death. Or one could be kicked out of the haven by the others. When a character leaves a shared-Haven relationship, the dots he contributed are removed from the pool. If the individual still survives, he doesn’t get all his dots back for his own purposes. He gets one less than he originally contributed. So, if a character breaks a relationship with his coterie, his two Haven dots are lost by the group, but he gets only one dot back for his own purposes. The lost dot represents the cost or bad image that comes from the breakup. If all members agree to part ways, they all lose one dot from what they originally contributed.\r\n\r\nThe Storyteller decides what reduced dots mean in the story when a character leaves a shared haven. Perhaps no one else picks up the character’s attention to Haven Security, leaving that to drop. The haven might not be tended as fastidiously, causing a drop in the Haven Location value. Maybe a portion of the haven falls into disuse or even collapses, causing an effective drop in Haven Size. Whatever the case, a plausible explanation must be determined.\r\n\r\nA character need not devote all of her Haven dots to the shared Haven Merit, of course. A Kindred might maintain a separate haven of her own outside the communal one represented by the shared trait. Any leftover dots that a character has (or is unwilling to share) signify what she has to draw upon as an individual, separate from her partners. For example, three characters share a haven and expend a group total of five dots. One character chooses to use two other dots on a private haven for herself. Those remaining two dots represent a haven entirely separate from what she and her partners have established together.\r\n\r\nTo record a shared Haven Merit on your character sheet, put an asterisk next to the name of the Haven Merit and fill in the total dots that your character has access to thanks to his partnership. In order to record his original contribution, write it in parentheses along with the Merit’s name. It is not important to note which aspect of the Haven Merit on which those points are spent, as this allows greater flexibility should a character ever decide to withdraw from the community arrangement.', 'Place secured from the sun', 'vampire', 2, 100, NULL),

(44, 'Status', 'social', 0, 1, 1, 5, 0, 0, 'While certain Merits detailed in the World of Darkness Rulebook focus on recognition in mortal society, certain Status concerns itself with the social orders of the night and represents recognition among other vampires. Status is divided into three areas — City, Clan and Covenant. Players must choose one of these three areas for each Merit point spent. (Enterprising Storytellers may come up with additional types of Status, and clever players might have unique applications as well. Status is designed as a sort of “umbrella” Merit, under which new types can be created.)\r\n\r\nCity Status represents a vested responsibility and according acknowledgement in the affairs of a domain. Regardless of clan and covenant, certain individuals rise to the top of the social or feudal strata, exemplary because of their efforts in the name of the domain as a whole. Princes, Regents, Primogen, Harpies and other “officers” of a given domain fit this description.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, City Status represents those Kindred who aren’t part of the prevailing social structure, but who nonetheless have significant esteem, sway or reputation among the Kindred. Examples include bosses of powerful gangs, Kindred who have considerable influence in specialized areas (prominent businessmen, city government, health care and hospitals, religious communities), or even just those who are powerful in their own right but largely apolitical, as with a potent elder who abstains from city responsibilities but whose territory is respected by all other local Kindred.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, City Status is very much a chicken-and-egg situation — does Prince Maxwell have City Status 5 because he’s Prince, or did his accumulated City Status result in his claiming praxis? In other cases, City Status obviously reflects accomplishment, as with a political activist who has many mortal supporters — but those supporters obviously didn’t join his cause because they knew he was a vampire. Harpies, in particular, make much of these distinctions, but some speculate that that’s because their own Status falls under the definition of City Status.\r\n\r\n• Hound or “rising star”\\\r\n•• Sheriff or “accomplished individual”\\\r\n••• Harpy, Seneschal, Master of Elysium or “much-deserved reputation”\\\r\n•••• Regent, Primogen, Herald or “cornerstone of Kindred society”\\\r\n••••• Prince or “true paragon”\r\n\r\nClan Status is concerned with lineage and the Blood. At the outset of a chronicle, a Kindred’s standing often reflects the prestige her sire has gained and passed along, such as with regard to the Ventrue. Many assume that childer who were Embraced by powerful and influential members of the clan have already shown some special quality or excellence, otherwise they would not have been chosen by so great a sire. This kind of recognition is short lived, however. A neonate might enjoy prestige by association under the purview of her sire, but such a favored childe is expected to make a name for herself.\r\n\r\nVampires who truly embody the ideals of their clan and who establish themselves in positions of power and influence (often as Prisci) gain the respect of others in their clan, being perceived as models for success. While the Daeva tell tales of particularly vicious Harpies of distant cities, the Gangrel speak of brooding hulks who confidently brave the Lupine-infested wilds alone. Those who diverge from the expected behavior of the clan in remarkable ways gain renown (or notoriety), as well, perhaps founding bloodlines that become known to vampire society as a whole.\r\n\r\nClan Status is not so rigidly defined as City Status. While individual clan titles might arise, the notion of esteem is more general in this context.\r\n\r\nCovenant Status represents rank, achievement and responsibility, less concerned with clan ideals and more with covenant actions, philosophies and accomplishments. The various covenants are not bound by any supernatural means or governed by clan lineage. They find a commonality of goals and ideologies, instead. It is not enough to be powerful or exemplary of clan ideals; a covenant is concerned with what its members have done to benefit its cause and combat its rivals.\r\n\r\nThose Kindred who enjoy the greatest covenant-based esteem are often the core members of their factions in a given city, those around whom others rally. These Kindred instigate or mediate conflict with other covenants, generally looking to further certain idealistic goals and establish themselves or other members in positions of influence in the local hierarchy. A Mekhet in command of a massive spy network might have status within his clan, but the lowliest of his spies might risk her unlife to gather a specific piece of information that helps oust the Invictus Prince, subsequently enjoying far more status with, say, the Ordo Dracul than her master.\r\n\r\nA character must have at least a single dot of Covenant Status in order to gain the benefits of any special abilities of that covenant. In other words, a character must have at least one dot of Covenant Status (Lancea Sanctum) in order to learn Theban Sorcery. Or a character must have at least one dot of Covenant Status (Invictus) to take advantage of the experience-point break on the Herd, Mentor, Resources and Retainer Merits. If a character leaves a covenant after learning some of its secrets, he does not lose any of those traits for which he paid experience points, but he may not learn additional dots of those traits (or additional dots at that particular price break, as with the Invictus and the Carthians). See p. 91-92 for the complete list of which covenants grant which benefits.\r\n\r\nLike Clan Status, Covenant Status is not so specifically tied to certain titles. It is more a notion of an individual’s accomplishments. A Lancea Sanctum Priest, for example, has a greater title than, say, a noted ethicist of the covenant, but that ethicist might have written numerous treatises on the state of undeath and the soul, according her more esteem among her peers than the Priest who rides solely on the weight of her title.\r\n\r\n• The character is known to a select subset of the clan/covenant — a spy network, perhaps.\r\n•• The majority of the clan/covenant in the city recognizes the character’s face and can recall her exploits.\r\n••• The character’s deeds are known to all in the local covenant, even in other nearby cities; many members of other covenants recognize her face.\r\n•••• Word of the character’s exploits has traveled far, and her name is known in cities around the country.\r\n••••• The character’s name and face are synonymous with her clan/covenant; her exploits are taught to new members of the clan/covenant.\r\n\r\nStatus can serve as a mixed blessing, however. Those who enjoy the most might be able to use it to their advantage, but they are also visible targets for their enemies. High levels of Status make it almost impossible to pass unnoticed, even while they open doors that would otherwise remain closed.\r\n\r\nStatus works like a “social tool” in that it adds to dice pools for social interactions between members of the sub-group in question. That is, Covenant Status adds to dice pools for interactions with members of the same covenant, Clan Status enhances interactions with members of the same Clan, and City Status affects those who are recognized residents of the given domain. City Status, however, may be ignored by those who are among the unbound.\r\n\r\n**Example:** Loki wants access to the Mekhet Priscus, but the Priscus is already occupied with an envoy from Clan Daeva. He instead finds himself dealing with one of her aides, another Mekhet. Loki, a Mekhet himself, tries to convince the aide that he has important business to discuss with the Priscus. His player adds Clan Status to a Manipulation + Persuasion dice pool. Loki has Manipulation 2, Persuasion 3 and Clan Status (Mekhet) 2, creating a pool of seven dice for the task.\r\n\r\nStatus does not add to dice pools predicated on supernatural powers. For example, a Prince’s City Status is not added to a dice pool for use of his Dread Gaze power. Dealing with Status can be a mire of responsibility, though clever characters can turn it to their advantage. They may actually have a variety of Status — it is not unheard of for a character to have City Status, Clan Status and Covenant Status. A character may have Clan Status only as a member of his own clan. For instance, a Nosferatu never gains Clan Status (Gangrel) no matter how much aid he provides the Savages. His aid of the Gangrel may certainly earn him esteem, but such concern is better handled on a case-by-case basis by the Storyteller, not in the form of Clan Status.\r\n\r\nCovenant Status is unique in that a character may, on occasion, have more than one form of it. This occurs almost exclusively at low levels, where a character is often beneath the notice of most other members of his covenants. A character may never have more than three dots total in Covenant Status among multiple covenants. A double-agent, for example, might take two dots worth of Covenant Status (Carthians) and a single dot of Covenant Status (Lancea Sanctum), representing the character’s true allegiance to the Carthians as well as the fact that he’s in on the ground floor of the Lancea Sanctum so that he can feed information back to his Carthian fellows. A character may even have a single dot of Covenant Status in three different covenants — perhaps he’s somewhat accomplished in each, but has yet to determine where his true loyalties lie. Naturally, a character with Status in only one Covenant is not beholden to the three-dot limit.\r\n\r\nA character with dots in Covenant Status through multiple factions does indeed gain access to those covenants’ special benefits. Covenants expect certain contributions of their members, however, and if other Kindred find out that the vampire in question plays multiple sides against the middle, he might see that Status vanish in a single night in which he’s called upon to account for his treacheries. Such is also the reason that cumulative Covenant Status is limited to three dots. By the time a character gains a certain degree of Status in a single covenant, he sticks out like a sore thumb if he turns up among another covenant’s members. (An exception to this might occur if a character is truly some sort of deep-cover agent or other mole, but that circumstance is best handled at the Storyteller’s discretion).', 'Status for Kindred society', 'vampire', 2, 102, NULL),

At this stage he learns the “empty hand” techniques of escrima.\r\n\r\n**Lock and Block (•):** With this move, your character uses an adversary’s momentum against her. If you succeed on a Strength + Weaponry roll, your character captures an opponent’s attacking arm in his own and gains a grapple over her (for grappling rules, see p. 157, **the World of Darkness Rulebook**). You may add your character’s Defense to the Strength + Weaponry roll, as he is technically making a defensive maneuver. However, if you choose to add his Defense to this attack, you may not apply his Defense against any incoming attacks that turn. If he has already applied his Defense, he may still utilize this maneuver, but he does not get to add his Defense to the roll.\r\n\r\n**Disarm (••):** This allows your character to capture an incoming attack and bring his own weapon down upon a foe’s forearm, potentially forcing the enemy to drop her weapon. (Note that this is different than the Disarm Merit.) To enact this maneuver, make a normal attack roll (Dexterity + Weaponry). Compare the successes on this roll against the opponent’s Stamina. If the successes are equal to or exceed her Stamina score, she drops the weapon. This attack does cause damage to the opponent, as well. Take the successes gained on the attack roll and halve them (round up). The opponent takes this damage, bashing.\r\n\r\n**Off-Balancing Attack (•••):** With this attack, your character uses his weapon to set a foe off-balance. This attack can take any form: thrusting a baton into a solar plexus, hitting a foe’s temple or the bridge of her nose or using a stick’s momentum to push her into an awkward position. The attack is made at a –2 penalty. If successful, the attack does full damage and the opponent’s next attack is made at a –3 penalty.\r\n\r\n**Many-Handed Defense (••••):** Escrima practitioners know how to move and flow with the combat in ways often unparalleled in other weapon-style systems. In this case, you may apply your character’s full Defense (or Dodge) to all attacks against him in a single turn.

Each maneuver is a prerequisite for the next. So, your character can’t have “Battlesight Zero” until she has “On Scope.” The maneuvers and their effects are described below, most of which are based on the Firearms Skill. All of the following maneuvers work only with rifles (including assault rifles).\n\n**On Scope (•):** Your character has an intuitive understanding of long-range ballistics and has spent countless hours straining to pick out tiny details through a telescopic sight. The maximum bonus she may receive from aiming (see **the World of Darkness Rulebook**, p. 162) is increased to her Composure +1 for semi-automatic and automatic rifles and her Composure +2 for break-action, bolt-action and lever-action rifles. In addition, when using a scope or other long-range optic device (e.g., binoculars), she receives a +2 bonus to all perception rolls (see **the World of Darkness Rulebook**, p. 45).\n\n**Battlesight Zero (••):** Once your character is familiar with the capabilities of a rifle, she can wring unparalleled performance from it. Whenever your character sights in a rifle (see “Sighting Tools,” p. 164), she doubles the number of attacks that receive the bonus from this process. In addition, whenever she makes an attack with a rifle that receives this bonus, the weapon’s short range is increased by five yards times her Wits, medium range by twice this amount and long range by three times this amount.\n\n**Focused Shot (•••):** Your character can lurk motionless in ambush for days, ignoring sleep deprivation, temperature extremes and even life-threatening injuries in the name of putting lead on target. When making an aimed shot, she may ignore an amount of penalties for wounds, drugs, disease, pain, fatigue, environmental conditions and similar factors equal to her Resolve. For example, if your character has Resolve 4, has two points of Health remaining (–2), has gone without sleep for 36 hours (–2) and has ingested strong hallucinogens (–3), her aimed shots suffer only a –3 penalty instead of the –7 that affects all her other dice pools.\n\n**Tactical Intervention (••••):** Split-second timing and nerves of steel enable your character to take advantage of the smallest opportunities for accurate shot placement. When making an aimed shot, all penalties for shooting into close combat and for concealment are halved, rounding down.\n\n**One Shot, One Kill (•••••):** When your character picks up her rifle, people fall down. It’s just that simple. When making an aimed shot, do not add the rifle’s Damage rating to the attack dice pool (though “9 again” or “8 again” still applies if it would normally). Instead, if the attack succeeds, add the rifle’s Damage rating as extra successes. **Drawback:** Spend one Willpower per attack. Note that this Willpower expenditure does not add three dice to the attack.', 'Your character is patient and skilled enough to spend hours staring through a rifle scope before taking one perfect shot', '', 3, 213, NULL);

Maneuvers involve a lot of quick, fluid movements complemented by a mixture of slashing and stabbing toward vital areas.\n\nDots purchased with this Merit allow access to unique combat maneuvers with a knife. Each maneuver is a prerequisite for the subsequent maneuver. Your character cannot have “Advantageous Angle” until he has “Anticipate Attack.” These maneuvers and their effects are described below. All maneuvers are based on the Weaponry Skill.\n\n**Anticipate Attack (•):** Those trained in Special Forces knife fighting know to move fast before incoming attacks and in response to them. To do this requires a level of anticipation and strategy even before a combat begins. At this level, your character may substitute his Weaponry score for his Composure when determining his Initiative modifier. This is only during combat situations in which your character is using an edged or pointed weapon of Size 2 or under.\n\n**Advantageous Angle (••):** Your knife-wielder knows how to make a feinted attack from the side or rear in a way that grants him advantage. While normally such attacks confer no bonuses, the character is aware how to deceive an opponent into mounting a Defense against an attack that isn’t coming — and then stage an attack from a different angle. The foe’s Defense is at –1 during such an attack. **Drawback:** This maneuver can only be made every other turn.\n\n**Vital Attack (•••):** Your character knows how to target his attacks to vital organs and other vulnerabilities.

All maneuvers are based upon the Weaponry Skill.\n\nNote that while a quarter-, bo or jo staff are the norm for this fighting style, the maneuvers are not limited to these weapons. A character can use any polearm for these maneuvers, but using other polearms with an item that isn’t one of the aforementioned three staff types requires an additional point of Weaponry (Weaponry •••). A character can also utilize improvised polearms (including post-hole diggers, scythes or other objects at least five feet in length) with this maneuvers. In such cases, the Weaponry ••• is still required, and all attack rolls are made with the appropriate improvised weapon penalties in place. Remember as well that utilizing a polearm in combat grants the wielder a +1 Defense.\n\n**Trip (•):** Your character can use her polearm to trip a single opponent, hopefully sending him to the ground. It is a contested roll pitting the character’s normal attack roll against the opponent’s Dexterity + Athletics. The character’s attack is penalized by the foe’s Defense, as usual. If the opponent falls, assume Knockdown rules (per p. 168, the **World of Darkness Rulebook**). In this case, however, the fall to the ground incurs a single point of bashing damage to the opponent.\n\n**Temple Strike (••):** Your character brings her staff against the side of her adversary’s head. The normal –3 penalty to hit the head still applies, but if the damage meets or exceeds the target’s Size, the target falls unconscious for a number of turns equal to the damage done. This damage is usually bashing, as it is meant to be performed with a blunt staff. The damage can be performed with a bladed weapon such as the naginata, however. The effect is the same, but the damage is now lethal instead of bashing.\n\n**Dangerous Radius (•••):** With this technique, your character can swing her weapon in a wide arc, hitting anyone within three yards. Make a normal attack roll for the character (Strength + Weaponry + weapon bonuses). This roll receives a dice penalty equal to the number of opponents hit with this strike (to a maximum of –5 dice). Successes achieved on this roll are done as damage to all within the three-yard radius. If the weapon is a normal blunt polearm (i.e., a staff), it does bashing. If bladed, the weapon causes lethal damage. **Drawback:** To perform this maneuver, the character must spend a Willpower point before she makes her initial attack roll.

Your character can rely on her regnant to provide information, extra Vitae, equipment or even to personally intervene on her behalf. Conversations with your character’s regnant might be genuine interpersonal dialogue rather than the simple dispensation of orders, and you might even find him turning to your character for true companionship. This doesn’t suggest that the ghoul is anything remotely like an equal to her regnant, just that she isn’t necessarily made to feel like a lowly, servile nonentity.\n\nThere are a variety of beneficial relationships with regnants. One ghoul might enjoy service to a generous master who isn’t significantly influential, while another is sheltered by her regnant’s status without receiving any special attention from him. **The advantages of this Merit are split into three factors — power, favor and trust**. Players who choose this Merit must also choose how to allocate these three factors when spending points. For instance, the first dot might go toward Regnant Power with two more going toward Regnant Favor. Each one of these characteristics has a limit of five dots, and the fifth dot costs two dots to purchase.\n\nA ghoul with a powerful regnant finds that her dealings with local Kindred and their ghouls are, while not simple, at least a bit easier. Her compatriots (and regnant’s compatriots) know who she serves, and probably won’t be eager to impede her, especially if the news of such interference reaches her regnant’s ears. A regnant represented by several dots in **Power** might hold a significant position in the city (such as a respected Primogen, Priscus or Prince), while one represented by just a couple could be an acknowledged member of a powerful covenant. **Each dot of Regnant Power confers a +1 die bonus on Persuasion, Intimidation and Socialize rolls when in conflict with a local ghoul or Kindred**. Regnants whose ghouls have no dots allocated thus are local bottom-feeders.\n\nNote that Regnant Power need not be a simple reflection of title or position. A Priscus regnant might actually earn very little respect from the local Kindred, while an unaligned vampire without ties to the local vampire community might be so old and dangerous as to be feared by all.\n\n**Regnant Favor** reflects the master’s willingness to provide her ghoul access to Vitae, resources and equipment. It doesn’t necessarily reflect an emotional bond between the regnant and ghoul as much as it does a measure of generosity. **Each dot of Regnant Favor could reflect an additional hit of Vitae (one at a time) that a ghoul may request from her regnant per month without risking his wrath**. Alternatively, **Regnant Favor could be used in place of Resources to determine whether a ghoul can afford to secure equipment**. A ghoul with three dots in Regnant Favor could requisition a heavy pistol from his regnant, while one with five dots could take one of his regnant’s sports cars from the vast warehouse-like garage. Regnants without any dots allocated to this category are typically tight-fisted with their resources (and Vitae) and not likely to give any gifts without some real convincing.\n\n**Regnant Trust** is a measure of the extraordinary quality of the relationship your character enjoys with her regnant. Some ghouls are simply well liked by their regnants and are more likely to be afforded some breathing room with respect to their performance. The Kindred knows that his trusted ghoul will perform whatever job has been set before her, so he’s willing to let some minor early setback slide. An especially trusting regnant might even gift his ghoul with tidbits of forbidden information, which might prove infinitely more valuable than a gun or a car. **Each dot of Regnant Trust confers a +1 die bonus on Persuasion rolls in dealings between your character and her regnant**. Regnants who are represented by having no dots allocated to this category don’t necessarily dislike their ghouls, they just fail to see any reason to be friendly with them.\n\nNote that ghoul characters may not share the Regnant Merit.

If a long-dormant Kindred is just arising from a period of torpor, his surviving legacy ghouls might start to key in on his hunger and confusion and be drawn to where their once-master has reemerged.

All purified are assumed to have a single legal identity and need pay no Merit dots for this privilege. However, if the purified has lived in a single legal identity for more than two decades, your character has almost certainly begun to have to use various minor forms of disguise to change his appearance so that it better matches his legal age.\n\nHaving a second identity allows purified to have an identity that matches his apparent age and it also allows him to easily vanish if any legal questions arise surrounding his activities. In addition, if your character’s body dies in such a way that others notice his death, he can use this alternate identity if there is no way for him to explain his perceived death. However, modern background checks, paper trails and bureaucratic scrutiny make acquiring a new identity far more difficult than it was in the past. Few characters have the skills to create a new identity for themselves. The vast majority must look for help, either from older and more experienced purified or from some mortal or supernatural source who is skilled in the various complex and highly illegal methods of acquiring such documents.\n\nThe number of dots spent on this Merit determines how convincing and in-depth the documentation surrounding this new life actually is. Alternate Identity (●) represents an identity that passes casual inspection, but not much else — a character can go shopping and get around in most daily situations, but any kind of trained scrutiny such as from a police officer or bureaucrat immediately identifies this identity as a fake. Alternate Identity (●●) creates an identity that will pass most forms of relatively cursory professional inspection, but cannot stand up to a sustained investigation. A police officer that pulls your character over will not automatically pick up anything unusual if she runs the character’s license plates or calls up his name in a database. However, if your character is arrested and the police begin a formal investigation his identity will quickly unravel. Alternate Identity (●●●●) represents an identity that is essentially as real as any identity can be — it takes a truly dedicated, competent and time-consuming search by trained professionals to uncover any hint that the purified isn’t exactly who he claims to be, at least as far as his documentation is concerned. This Merit may be purchased multiple times at multiple ratings, each time representing a different identity. Also, an identity may also be upgraded later with the appropriate in-game explanation and experience expenditure. In the case of certain Merits such as Resources or Status, it might also be worth noting to which identity these Merits are tied, since a character may not easily be able to access or maintain them if that identity is compromised.\n\n**Drawback:** Although one-dot Alternate Identities require no maintenance, both of the more thorough versions do. If someone checks on a legal identity, they will immediately become suspicious if the person has no legal address or magazine subscriptions, pays no taxes and has no phone number. Similarly, if all of this data exactly matches your character’s primary legal identity, many people soon realize both of these identities belong to the same individual. Therefore, your character must take time and spend money to maintain any two or four-dot Alternate Identities. Having the identity make frequent trips to remote locations and similar inventive dodges can reduce the frequency of this maintenance. The amount of maintenance needed to keep a two-dot identity looking legitimate is fairly minimal, requiring only a few hours of work every month. However, keeping a four-dot identity believable requires at least several hours of work every week. Failure to perform this upkeep on an identity causes it to be reduced to the next lowest level.

The Nosferatu can still feel when the sun rises, however: his muscles tighten, his skin grows a bit waxy, a bit tough. This only applies when the Nosferatu is at least 30 feet below the surface of the world above and runs no chance of seeing the sun. Sewer tunnels that open up to the street still could have faint shafts of sunlight poking through: but the tunnels beneath the tunnels likely have never seen that kind of light.

(89, 'Unliving Anchor', 'social', 0, 1, 1, 5, 0, 0, 'The Nosferatu is ghost-touched, literally acting as a specter’s anchor in this world. Why is this? It’s most likely because the ghost is tied somehow to the Nosferatu. If the Nosferatu claimed the person as a victim accidentally, that person may continue in this world, fettered to the Haunt. The ghost may have once been a member of the Nosferatu’s own family, perhaps even a wife or a child that “lives on” as a specter, bound to the immortal vampire. It is possible, though, that the ghost has no actual connection to the character. Perhaps the character somehow convinces the ghost that he is someone other than he truly is, or perhaps the specter is grief-struck and lonely and gloms onto the Haunt because it senses a kind of “kinship in death.”\n\nThis Merit works similarly to the Retainer Merit (p. 116, **World of Darkness Rulebook**). Each acquisition of this Merit grants the character one spectral follower that claims him as anchor. Dots spent in the trait indicate the strength and ability of the ghost at hand. One or two dots suggests something akin to the power level of an apparition. Three dots are likely equiva- lent to the dice pools (though not necessarily the demeanor) of a poltergeist. Four dots suggests something on par with a deceiver, while five dots is closer to the level of a skinrider. (All such spectral types can be found on pp. 214-216, **World of Darkness Rulebook**.) The ghost, however, has a number of Numina equal to the dots purchased in this Merit: no more, no less, regardless of the suggested trait levels.\n\nFor the most part, the ghosts do as the Nosferatu bids, though certainly they cannot affect the world as a human retainer would. In addition, the Nosferatu gains no bonuses to communicate with the spirit, and may have to work to get his messages or commands heard (or felt).\n\n**Drawback:** Ghosts are persistent and somewhat invasive. The ghost will perform tasks as the Nosferatu bids, but keep in mind this is a two-way street. From time to time, the ghost will demand that the Nosferatu do its bidding. It may have an ancient enemy it seeks to dispatch or may want something far simpler, like to have the character visit its grave and put a certain type of flower upon it. A good rough guideline for Storytellers is that for every three commands the Nosferatu gives the ghost, the ghost will give one in return. If the Nosferatu fails to perform such a task, assume that the Merit loses a dot. This loss of a dot might represent the ghost literally losing power, or it might instead indicate that the ghost is unwilling to devote the breadth of its abilities for the Nosferatu’s needs. Dots can be regained through story and the appropriate experience points. If all the dots disappear, assume that the ghost is either gone forever, or is now hostile toward the character.', 'The Nosferatu becomes an anchor for a ghost, whose numina equals the purchased dots.

One Haunt might wear a sacred animal mask (bearing the vicious countenance of a bat or enraged dog), while another might wear something that evokes eerie beauty (perhaps feminine beauty, even on the face of a male Nosferatu). Leather bondage mask? Sure. A plaster death mask of an American president? Could be. A Mexican luchadore mask topped with a knot of real hair, stolen from some victim somewhere? Absolutely.\n\nWhy would they wear such masks? Different reasons for different Damned. The Haunts recognize that they’re... bizarre if not necessarily in appearance then in the vampire’s aura, and a mask may help to conceal more overt deformities (though it can also heighten the sense of strangeness, which is fine for many Nosferatu). Others use masks to frighten enemies, given that a freakish ceramic countenance can do a lot to accentuate the terror such a creature causes. Some are shrinking violets and try to hide from the world behind masks. Some... well, they just like the anonymity. A mask allows the Haunt to be someone different. Something new. Perhaps even inhuman.\n\nA normal mask worn by a Nosferatu might offer a minor (+1) equipment bonus: the frozen screeching rictus of a monkey mask might offer +1 to Intimidation, for instance, while a beautiful and delicate dramaturgical mask might grant a +1 to Expression in the right circumstances. That’s all well and good. But it doesn’t require Merit dots.\n\nWhat does require the purchase of a Merit is what’s called an “Unyielding Mask.” In this case, it’s a mask that’s literally affixed to the face. For the most part, permanently. Perhaps it’s bolted to the face. Or the skin has been peeled back and stitched or stapled to the fabric. Or the Nosferatu used his own Vitae as a coagulant glue, bonding it to his pallid flesh.\n\nIt’s important to note that the mask gains its power not simply from being a frightening or beautiful mask, but because it literally bonds with the Nosferatu’s eerie aura and his disturbed flesh.\n\nAt three dots, Unyielding Mask protects against any Discipline that attempts to mentally or socially coerce the Nosferatu (Dominate, Majesty, Nightmare), earning the Nosferatu a +2 to the rolls to resist or a -2 to the foe if no such resistance roll is expected. At four dots, the Unyielding Mask allows the Nosferatu to gain a persistent +1 to a Social Skill of the player’s choice. As above, Intimidation and Expression are viable, but so is any Skill. Subterfuge might gain a bonus from a snake-like mask (serpent’s tongue and all that), while Animal Ken might gain its bonus from being soothing or frightening in some primal, wild way.\n\n**Drawback:** The Unyielding Mask can be targeted and destroyed. Assume that any mask has a Durability of 3 and has a number of Health equal to the Nosferatu’s own, halved (round down). Bashing damage does not affect the Unyielding Mask, but lethal and aggravated do. The Nosferatu cannot heal the mask directly, but the mask does heal one point of damage when the Haunt awakens for the first time in the evening (and expends the single Vitae to do so). If the Mask is destroyed, it confers a single aggravated level of damage to the Nosferatu.', 'Permanently affixes a mask to the face, granting +2 to resist mental and social Disciplines.

Penalties to hit specific targets are reduced by one. See “Specified Targets,” p. 165. Even when a specific part of an opponent is not targeted, armor penalties to your character’s Brawl attacks are reduced by one.\r\n\r\n**Iron Skin (••):** Your character has hardened his body to physical blows, allowing him to withstand repeated hits with minimal effect.

Your character still suffers the -2 offhand penalty when attacking with a weapon in his secondary hand (unless you have also pur- chased the Ambidextrous Merit). \r\n\r\nDots purchased in this Merit allow access to special combat maneuvers. Each maneuver is a prerequisite for the next. So, your character can’t have “Deflect and Thrust” until he has “Whirling Blades.” The maneuvers and their effects are detailed below, all of which are based on the Weaponry Skill.\r\n\r\n**Whirling Blades (•):** Your character’s Dodge trait (Defense doubled; see p. 156) is not penalized by multiple attacks staged against him in a turn until the number of attacks exceeds his Weaponry dots, at which point each attack thereafter reduces his Dodge by -1. So, if your char- acter (with 2 Defense and 3 Weaponry) dodges attacks in a turn, the first three incoming attacks suffer his full Dodge trait as a penalty (-4). The fourth suffers a -3 penalty, the fifth suffers a -2 penalty, and so on. Basically, your character’s weapons move so quickly all about him that opponents in close combat have trouble reaching or assaulting him. The Brawling Dodge Merit (see p. 110) cannot replace normal Dodge (Defense doubled) when this maneuver is performed.\r\n\r\n**Deflect and Thrust (••):** Your character can avoid attacks and strike back in the same motion. When using this maneuver, your character gains +2 to his Defense for the turn, but any attack he makes suffers a -2 penalty. He can move no more than his Speed while performing a Deflect and Thrust maneuver in a turn.\r\n\r\n**Focused Attack (•••):** Your character can attack a single target twice in one turn. The second attack suffers a -1 penalty. Drawback: Your character cannot use his Defense against any attack in the same turn in which he intends to use this maneuver. If he uses Defense against attacks that occur earlier in the Initiative roster, before he can perform this maneuver, he cannot perform the maneuver this turn. He is too busy bobbing and weaving out of the way of attacks.\r\n\r\n**Fluid Attack (••••):** Your character can make a single attack on two different targets in one turn. The targets cannot be a distance apart in excess of your character’s Speed trait. The second attack suffers a -1 penalty. \r\n\r\n**Drawback:** Your character cannot use his Defense against any attack in the same turn in which he intends to use this maneuver.

Exceeding the confines of authority or proper channels transcends the limits of the Status Merit. Going above and beyond — to ask for favors rather than give orders or to requisition an official request — enters the realm of the Allies Merit. So, a police detective who gets a lower-ranking officer to investigate a case may do so with Status. That request is conducted through proper channels. Meanwhile, a police detective who asks another officer to overlook some evidence or to delay an investigation does so with Allies. The favor is asked outside official channels.\r\n\r\nWhile Status might allow your character to give orders to underlings, the Merit doesn’t automatically get results. Subordinates or co-workers might resent their assignments, dislike your character or have personal agendas that interfere with your character’s needs. Efforts to get things done through official channels still call for Manipulation + Intimidation, Persuasion or Socialize rolls, whichever Skill is appropriate to the request, circumstances and your character’s standing within the organization. Bonus dice equal your character’s Status dots. Penalties might apply if your character browbeats someone (- 1), uses threats (-2), skirts the limits of his authority (-2) or exceeds his authority (-3 to -5).\r\n\r\nSome sample organizations and the basic benefits, perks and privileges of standing in them are listed below.\r\n\r\n**City Police:** A patrol officer has legal powers of search, seizure and arrest, is permitted to carry a firearm at all times and has access to a wide range of local databases. High-ranking officers (•••+) can initiate investigations, coordinate with neighboring county or state police, and call in urban-assault teams.\r\n\r\n**Clerical Standing:** Your character is a licensed minister, gaining access to people and places such as accused criminals, hospital patients, crime and accident scenes, and restricted areas in religious institutions. **Prerequisite:** Academics Skill Specialty: Religion.\r\n\r\n**Corporate Executive:** A low-level corporate executive has access to much of the company’s resources, including corporate credit cards, vehicles, cell phones and computer equipment. Depending on the company, he can also access sources of information and influence not available to the general public. Executives (•••+) have larger salaries, expense accounts, and hiring and firing powers, not to mention social perks and access to connected political figures and/or celebrities.\r\n\r\n**Diplomat:** Your character is a registered diplomat for a sovereign country. If he works in a foreign country he has free lodging, access to his country’s embassy and immunity from foreign criminal prosecution. **Prerequisites:** Politics •• and Persuasion ••.\r\n\r\n**Licensed Professional:** Your character is licensed in a recognized profession that affords him privileges unavailable to most civilians. He might be a private investigator and authorized to carry a concealed weapon and to have access to restricted databases and government files, or he could be a building contractor and be authorized to own and use explosives for professional applications. **Prerequisite:** Academics Skill Specialty: Law (private investigator), Science Skill Specialty: Demolitions (building contractor).\r\n\r\n**Medical:** Your character is licensed to practice medicine. He can write prescriptions, access medical records and gain access to restricted areas such as crime and accident scenes. **Prerequisite:** Medicine ••.\r\n\r\n**Military:** An enlisted soldier has a monthly stipend, is permitted to possess military-grade firearms and has access to restricted sources of information and equipment. If he is an active-duty soldier he receives free room andboard and medical care. High-ranking soldiers (•••+) are officers who can command units, requisition military equipment and perhaps even initiate foreign insurgencies.\r\n\r\n**Rotary Club:** A basic member in good standing has access to the local meeting hall and a network of members who can provide club-related information or perform club-related duties. A basic member can also benefit from the organization’s emergency fund in times of need. High-ranking members (•••+) have access to other clubs around the country, and have sway over connected civic groups and political figures. \r\n\r\n**Drawback:** Your character’s standing in a given organization is dependent on the fulfillment of his duties and on abiding by the regulations required of members.'),

(122, 'fr', 'App\\Entity\\Merit', 'effect', '41', 'Your character is exceptionally attractive by modern standards; heads turn and conversations stop when she enters a room. \r\n\r\nFor two dots, your character gets a +1 modifier to all Presence or Manipulation rolls when she attempts to use her looks to entertain, persuade, distract or deceive others. \r\n\r\nFor four dots, your character’s looks are angelic; she gets a +2 modifier.\r\n\r\n**Drawback:** The more attractive your character is, the harder it is for her to avoid notice in public. Witnesses to any criminal acts are much more likely to remember your character’s appearance, and easily recognize her in a lineup. Your character is also likely to receive a great degree of unwanted attention in social situations.'),

(1, 'Academics', 'mental', 'Doctor Carlton’s library was a shambles. Bookshelves leaned on broken supports as if drunk, and piles of antiquated tomes lay scattered amid bits of broken glass and ceramic on the carpeted floor. Julia picked her way through the debris to Carlton’s desk and examined a large, leather-bound book resting on the ink-stained blotter. “It’s his journal,” she said, running a slim finger over the careful lines of script. “The last thing he wrote looks like Latin: ‘mali principii malus finis.’”\n\n“The bad end of a bad beginning,” Stapleton translated, bleakly surveying the damage from the doorway. “I told him that damned idol would be the death of him.”', 'Academics is a broad-based Skill that represents a character’s degree of higher education and general knowledge in the Arts and Humanities — everything from English to history, economics to law. Dots in this Skill do not directly correlate to a given level of education. Your character could have entered a doctorate program but spent more time partying than studying, resulting in low dots. Conversely, a self-taught individual who read voraciously and studied intensively could have high dots without ever earning a diploma.\r\n\r\n**Possessed by:** College graduates, executives, lawyers, librarians, scholars, students\r\n\r\n**Specialties:** Anthropology, Art, English, History, Law, Religion, Research\r\n\r\n#### Roll Results\r\n**Dramatic Failure:** Your character fails to remember crucial facts, incorrectly informing his actions. A charac- ter with a history background may remember an incorrect set of dates that completely alters his theory on a certain event, or a former art student might incorrectly identify a painting as a worthless copy instead of a priceless original.\\\r\n**Failure:** Your character is unable to summon the necessary information. It’s on the tip of his tongue, but the name, date or reference eludes him.\\\r\n**Success:** Your character is able to summon the necessary knowledge to serve his needs.\\\r\n**Exceptional Success:** Your character recalls or knows especially obscure or detailed facts that give him additional insight into the matter at hand. She not only identifies a particular work of art but recalls that the artist was renowned for his fascination with demons and the occult.', 'academics'),
(2, 'Computer', 'mental', 'The photo was a grainy digital reproduction, but the faces of the uniformed men were clear enough to be recognizable. Carla pointed a trembling finger at one of them. “That’s Mr. Denisov. Oh my God, where did you get this?”  As grim as the situation was, Robert couldn’t help but smile. “There’s a newsgroup dedicated to supernatural research conducted by the Soviets during World War II. You can find damn near anything on the net if you know where to look.”', 'Characters possessing this Skill have the necessary training or experience to operate a computer. At high levels (3 or more), a character can create his own computer programs. People with high levels in this Skill are familiar with a variety of programming languages and operating systems. Note that dots in Computer do not apply to manually fixing or building machines, only to operating them. Construction and repair is the province of the Crafts Skill (see below).\r\n\r\n**Possessed by:** Businesspeople, professors, programmers, students, sysadmins\r\n\r\n**Specialties:** Artificial Intelligence, Data Retrieval, Graphics, Hacking, Internet\r\n\r\n#### Roll Results\r\n**Dramatic Failure:** Your character has caused a system crash, interrupting any work in progress and forcing him to start his efforts from scratch. Data may be lost at the Storyteller’s discretion.\\\r\n**Failure:** The task your character attempts to execute does not go off properly or the database query he makes returns no useful information.\\\r\n**Success:** Your character’s function executes properly or his queries come back with the correct information.\\\r\n**Exceptional Success:** Your character’s program or function executes more quickly and efficiently than expected.', 'computer'),
(3, 'Crafts', 'mental', 'Howard pressed the carving tool gently against the smoothly spinning wood, shaving off a steady curl of pine with the whispery, scratching sound that he once loved. He hadn’t been down in his workshop since Angela died. He’d forgotten how much he enjoyed working with his hands.  He heard the basement door open, and Martha’s voice, heavy as lead, sank down the stairs. “Dad? What are you doing down there?”  “Just a quick project, hon,” he called back over his shoulder. “Should be done in a few more minutes.”  “Okay. Listen... I’m going to start cleaning out mom’s stuff. I could use some help.”  Howard put down the carving tool and switched off the lathe. He tried to keep his voice even. “I’ve got to go out for a while today. Can it wait till I get back?”  Not waiting for an answer, he undid the clamps and pulled the chair leg from the lathe. The end was now tapered to a fine, strong point.', 'Crafts represents a character’s training or experience in creating works of physical art or construction with his hands, from paintings to car engines to classical sculpture. Characters possessing this Skill typically have the knowledge, but not necessarily the tools or facilities to make use of their capabilities. A character might be an exceptional mechanic, for example, but still needs to sweet-talk his boss into opening up the garage after-hours to work on his friend’s car. Crafting a piece of art or creating an object is almost always an extended roll, with the length of time and number of successes required determined by the complexity of the piece. The Storyteller has final say on the time required and the number of successes needed for a particular item.\r\n\r\n**Possessed by:** Contractors, mechanics, plumbers, sculptors, welders\r\n\r\n**Specialties:** Automobiles, Aircraft, Forging, Jury-Rigging, Sculpting, Sewing\r\n\r\n#### Roll Results\r\n**Dramatic Failure:** Your character makes a horrible mistake in creating the piece, ruining it in the process. The chisel hits a flaw in the stone, shattering the statue, or he over-tightens the pipe, stripping the threads. He must begin the job from scratch.\\\r\n**Failure:** Your character makes no progress in creating the item in question.\\\r\n**Success:** Your character makes progress in crafting the piece (apply successes rolled toward the total needed).\\\r\n**Exceptional Success:** Your character makes substantial progress in crafting the piece — a sudden burst of inspiration or a breakthrough in fabrication speeds up the process dramatically (apply successes rolled toward the total needed).', 'crafts'),
(4, 'Investigation', 'mental', 'All the other detectives were convinced. An arsonist had set the hotel fire and vandalized the fire hydrant out front so firefighters couldn’t put out the blaze. But Janet wasn’t so sure. The hydrant was literally ripped from of its moorings. Who could do that without something like a truck and tow chains? Who could do that so quickly, without being seen? She contemplated the answer as she picked through the building’s smoldering remains. When she stumbled across a charred wooden stake, she knew something was not as it seemed.', 'Investigation is the art and science of solving mysteries, examining seemingly disparate evidence to find a connection, answering riddles and overcoming paradoxes. It not only allows your character to get into the head of a killer to grasp his motives or plans, it allows her to look beyond the mundane world to guess at answers to mysterious problems, or to have a “eureka” moment that offers insight into baffling circumstances. Your character might realize that all murder victims have the same digits jumbled in their phone numbers, she might interpret a dream that has striking similarities to events in the real world, or she could recognize why an intruder took the time to paint a room red. Certain individuals such as law-enforcement officers, forensic specialists, scientists and investigators are trained in the art of examination, while others simply develop the knack through years of practice. Note that Investigation is different from the perception Attribute task detailed on p. 45. Perception (Wits + Composure or Wits + another Skill) is typically checked when a character could spot something unusual or amiss when she isn’t actually looking for it. Investigation-based rolls are typically made when a character actively studies a situation. Dots in Investigation don’t give a character sudden insight or capability in the realms of other Skills, however. She can’t miraculously identify changing brushstrokes in a painting, for example. That would be the realm of Academics or Crafts. But she might identify how the placement of paintings throughout a house creates a pattern and imparts a message.\r\n\r\n**Possessed by:** Criminals, doctors, forensic examiners, police officers, scientists, scholars, soldiers\r\n\r\n**Specialties:** Artifacts, Body Language, Crime Scenes, Cryptography, Dreams, Autopsy Diagnoses, Puzzles, Riddles, Scientific Experiments\r\n\r\n#### Roll Results\r\n**Dramatic Failure:** Your character studies an individual or situation and draws an incorrect conclusion or focuses on the wrong details.\\\r\n**Failure:** Your character fails to notice the details or information for which she searches. It might be right under her nose but she overlooks it.\\\r\n**Success:** Your character studies the situation or problem and finds useful details that answer her questions. A single success might be sufficient to solve a simple puzzle, but more successes may be required to gather extensive clues. The Storyteller may offer small insights with each success in an examination, starting with the obvious and ending with the obscure.\\\r\n**Exceptional Success:** Your character studies and not only discovers useful details about a person or situation, but notices additional clues that provide more in-depth information. Not only have the murder victims at two separate scenes been killed elsewhere and dumped, they both possess matchbooks from the same bar.\r\n', 'investigation'),
(5, 'Medicine', 'mental', 'The Land Rover’s tires squealed as Anderson took the turn as fast as he dared. Wind whistled through the bullet holes in the windshield. “Jesus Christ!” he yelled, his hands wrestling with the SUV’s steering wheel. “How bad is it?” Robert was slumped on his side in the back seat, a thin, keening moan escaping his lips. Jenny clambered out of the passenger seat and looked him over. There wasn’t much she could see in the shifting bands of light from the street lamps. Biting her lip, she ran her hands over Robert’s chest and back. When she held them up to the light, they were red-black with blood. “Shit,” she said, noting a froth of bubbles in the blood on her palms. “The bullet’s hit his right lung. I need a credit card!”  “What?”  “Plastic! I need something stiff and waterproof that I can use to plug the hole or his lung will collapse! Give me your damn wallet!”', 'The Medicine Skill reflects a character’s training and expertise in human physiology and how to treat injuries and illness. The trait represents knowledge of human anatomy and basic medical treatments. Characters with a low level in this Skill (1 to 2) often possess only rudimentary first-aid training, while characters with high levels (3+) are the equivalent of physicians or surgeons.\r\n\r\n**Possessed by:** Medical students, paramedics, physicians, psychologists, surgeons\r\n\r\n**Specialties:** Emergency Care, Pathology, Pharmaceuticals, Physical Therapy, Surgery\r\n\r\n#### Roll Results\r\n**Dramatic Failure:** Your character has made an improper diagnosis of a patient’s condition and his treatment makes the condition worse. The more serious the condi- tion, the greater the harm. Misdiagnosing a cold instead of a virus might only make the sickness last longer, while improperly treating a gunshot wound may result in infection or death.\\\r\n**Failure:** Your character’s diagnosis or treatment has no effect on the patient’s condition.\\\r\n**Success:** Your character’s diagnosis and treatment improves the patient’s condition.\\\r\n**Exceptional Success:** Your character’s treatment and diagnosis is so effective that the patient’s recovery time is decreased.', 'medicine'),
(6, 'Occult', 'mental', 'Samantha flicked on the light in the pantry and scanned the shelves. “C’mon, I know mom keeps a box of the stuff around here somewhere.” Absently, she gestured at Lisa. “Get me the cookie jar on the counter. If there’s anything in it, empty it out.”  Lisa opened the jar and spilled its contents — a scattering of stale crumbs and a small plastic bag with a spare key — and carried the ceramic jar to the kitchen table. “Are you sure this is going to work?”  “Ah! There you are!” Samantha pulled the box of sea salt from one of the top shelves. Back at the table, she poured half the salt into the cookie jar. “Sea salt drains spiritual energy from objects,” she said, fishing Mr. Chamber’s pocket watch from her jacket. “Or, at least, that’s what the book says.”  She dropped the watch into the jar and poured the rest of the salt over it. “I guess we’ll know for sure by midnight,” Samantha said grimly, sealing the jar.', 'The Occult Skill reflects a character’s knowledge and experience with the world’s various legends and lore about the supernatural. A character with this Skill not only knows the theories, myths and legends of the occult, but can generally discern “fact” from rumor. Characters may come by this Skill in a variety of ways, from oddball college courses to learning legends and myths from the lips of superstitious family members.\r\n\r\n**Possessed by:** Anthropologists, authors, neo-pagans, occult scholars, parapsychologists\r\n\r\n**Specialties:** Cultural Beliefs, Ghosts, Magic, Monsters, Superstitions, Witchcraft\r\n\r\n#### Roll Results\r\n**Dramatic Failure:** Your character mistakenly identifies an example of occult phenomena or remembers incorrect information that impacts his decisions for the worse. Depending on the situation, this flawed information could be deadly.\\\r\n**Failure:** Your character is unable to identify or remember any useful facts about the situation at hand.\\\r\n**Success:** Your character properly identifies or remembers facts about an example of occult phenomena.\\\r\n**Exceptional Success:** Your character is able to identify or answer questions about a particular example of occult phenomena in great detail, possibly recalling extra details that enhance his understanding of the broader situation. Not only does he successfully identify the ancient grimoire, he recalls that only one known copy was believed to exist, and it belonged to a famous occult scholar who reportedly committed suicide.', 'occult'),
(7, 'Politics', 'mental', 'Edgar Young spread his pasty, perfectly manicured hands and gave Wilson one of his trademark grins. “Mr. Wilson, I’m the governor’s political advisor, not a member of the Public Health Service. I don’t have the authority to do what you’re asking.”  “No, but the Public Health Commissioner is a political appointee, and if memory serves, he’s one of the governor’s golf buddies,” Wilson replied. “I’m sure if you made a suggestion to the governor — and pointed out to him the risks of being implicated in a criminal cover-up — he’d persuade the commissioner to close the orphanage. Then we can relocate the kids until we finish investigating the disappearances.”  The condescending smirk melted from Young’ s face. “Let me make a few calls,” he said coldly.', 'Characters possessing this Skill are not only familiar with the way the political process works, they’re experienced with bureaucracies and know exactly who to call in a given situation to get something done. Your character keeps track of who’s in power and how she got there, along with her potential rivals. He has a grasp of the issues of the moment and how they affect the political process, and knows whose palms to grease. It’s possible that your character acquired this Skill by running for political office at some point, or by working on a campaign or as a public servant. Or he could simply be someone who follows the news and understands the money trail.\r\n\r\n**Possessed by:** Bureaucrats, civil servants, journalists, lawyers, lobbyists, politicians\r\n\r\n**Specialties:** Bribery, Elections, Federal, Local, State, Scandals\r\n\r\n#### Roll Results\r\n**Dramatic Failure:** Your character has seriously misread the current political or bureaucratic climate. At best, he might find his efforts stonewalled by spiteful civil servants. At worst, he might be arrested for attempted bribery or be caught up in a public spectacle.\\\r\n**Failure:** Your character makes no headway in his efforts in the political arena. Perhaps he can’t get the right politician to return his calls or a recent shakeup in an office means he has to work harder to find the right “in.”\\\r\n**Success:** Your character achieves his objective.\\\r\n**Exceptional Success:** Your character not only gains his objective quickly and efficiently, he makes new friends and associates in the bargain, possibly increasing his chances for success in future endeavors.', 'politics'),
(8, 'Science', 'mental', 'The young man’s body looked far worse beneath the harsh light of the autopsy table than it did at the crime scene. The antiseptic glare revealed his terrible injuries in gruesome detail. Even Wagner’s partner Robison had a hard time concealing his discomfort. Wagner took out a notepad. “What have you got, Doc?”  Dr. Feingold, the city’s medical examiner, chose his words carefully. “For starters, the four lacerations across the victim’s chest are equidistant from one another, and measurements indicate that they struck the body with equal force. Thus, I believe that they were inflicted at the same moment, rather than separately.  Wagner eyed the four deep furrows running diagonally across the man’s chest. They’d cut through tissue and bone as cleanly as a saw. “Four guys couldn’t have done that at the same time. No way.”  “Not four assailants, Detective.” Feingold raised his left hand to the light. “Four fingers. These are claw marks.”', 'This Skill represents your character’s understanding of the physical and natural sciences: biology, chemistry, geology, meteorology, physics. Science is useful not only for understanding how the world works, but it helps characters make the most of the resources at hand to achieve their goals. A character with a strong Science background could describe the chemical process for plating metals, for example, allowing another character with Crafts to make a silver-edged steel sword.\r\n\r\n**Possessed by:** Engineers, scientists, students, teachers, technicians\r\n\r\n**Specialties:** Biology, Chemistry, Geology, Metallurgy, Physics\r\n\r\n#### Roll Results\r\n**Dramatic Failure:** Your character fails to remember crucial facts, incorrectly informing his actions with potentially explosive results. He mixes an acid into a base instead of a base into an acid, or otherwise causes his efforts to fail spectacularly.\\\r\n**Failure:** Your character is unable to summon the necessary information from memory. It’s on the tip of his tongue, but the formula, chemical or equation eludes him.\\\r\n**Success:** Your character is able to summon the necessary knowledge to serve his needs.\\\r\n**Exceptional Success:** Your character recalls especially obscure or detailed facts that give him additional options or capabilities with the resources at hand.', 'science'),
(9, 'Athletics', 'physical', 'John made it onto the balcony just as the hotel room door opened. There wasn’t time to close the elegant French doors to the patio, and the breeze already ruffled the drapes. It wouldn’t be long before Logan — or worse, one of his pale-faced bodyguards — noticed and checked outside.  There was nowhere to hide. John looked about frantically and saw that the balconies to either side were at least 12 feet away — too far to risk a jump at 20 stories up.  John stared down at the balcony below and tried not to think about how small the cars looked. He swung his legs over the railing, taking all his weight on his arms, and hoped that all the rock climbing he’d done last summer would pay off.', 'Athletics encompasses a broad category of physical training, from rock climbing to kayaking to professional sports such as football or hockey. The Athletics Skill can be applied to any action that requires prolonged physical exertion or that demands considerable agility or hand-eye coordination. Examples include climbing a high wall, marching long distances and leaping between rooftops. In combat, the Skill is combined with Dexterity to determine the accuracy of thrown weapons.\r\n\r\n**Possessed by:** Professional athletes, police officers, soldiers, survivalists, physical trainers\r\n\r\n**Specialties:** Acrobatics, Climbing, Kayaking, Long-Distance Running, Sprinting, Swimming, Throwing\r\n\r\n#### Roll Results\r\n**Dramatic Failure:** The effort not only fails, but your character injures himself. It might be a sprained muscle or ligament, which inflicts a single point of bashing damage. Risky efforts such as climbing up the side of a building or swimming a long distance can have severe repercussions. See the rules on falling (p. 179) and holding one’s breath (p. 49).\\\r\n**Failure:** Your character fails to accomplish the attempted action. His throw misses the mark. He doesn’t make it to the far rooftop. In the case of an extended physical action such as climbing or long-distance running, he doesn’t lose ground but does not make any headway, either.\\\r\n**Success:** Your character accomplishes the action as planned. His throw hits the mark. He gains on the fleeing, shadowy figure. He catches the falling baby.\\\r\n**Exceptional Success:** Your character completes the attempted action with greater efficiency or power than anticipated. A masterful feat of balance and agility makes a rock-climbing attempt much swifter and smoother than expected. He catches the falling baby and her loose pacifier.', 'athletics'),
(10, 'Brawl', 'physical', 'He was the stereotypical biker: big and broad-shouldered, the sleeves of his T-shirt straining around muscled, tattooed arms. He loomed over Miles. “You and me are gonna have a little fun, college boy,” he said through yellow teeth. “And then me and your girlfriend here are gonna have a little party.”  Miles leaned back and the biker took the bait, bending down to glare at the young history student. Miles’ first punch struck the biker square in the Adam’s apple. The gag reflex doubled the man over, and Miles followed up with a shot to the ear.  The biker hit the floor like a sack of wet cement. “Party on, asshole,” Miles said in the silence that followed, and then took Angela’s hand. “Let’s get out of here.”', 'Brawl defines your character’s prowess at unarmed combat, whether he’s a black belt in karate, a hard-bitten street tough or a college student who’s taken a few selfdefense courses. Characters with this Skill know how to hit an opponent, where to hit for maximum effect and how to defend themselves from attack. It can mean using fists, but also elbows, knees, shoulders, head butts wrestling, joint locks and choke holds. Characters with a sev- eral dots could be familiar with multiple techniques of unarmed combat. Expertise in such techniques is reflected in the Fighting Style Merits (see pp. 110-112), which are based on Brawl.\r\n\r\nBrawl is added to your character’s Strength to battle people in unarmed combat.\r\n\r\n**Possessed by:** Bikers, boxers, gangsters, police officers, soldiers\r\n\r\n**Specialties:** Blocking, Boxing, Dirty Tricks, Grappling, Kung Fu, Throws\r\n\r\n#### Roll Results\r\n**Dramatic Failure:** Not only does your character fail to hit his opponent, the attack leaves him wide open for a counterblow. Your character’s Defense or Dodge trait does not apply to the next close-combat attack staged against him.\\\r\n**Failure:** Your character’s attack misses its target.\\\r\n**Success:** Your character scores a hit against his opponent. See Chapter 7 for details on combat and inflicting damage.\\\r\n**Exceptional Success:** Your character lands a particularly powerful blow or hits his opponent in a vital area, increasing damage.\r\n\r\n**Suggested Equipment:** Roll of quarters (+1), brass knuckles (+1), sap gloves (+3)\r\n\r\n**Possible Penalties:** Slippery conditions (-1), bad weather (-1 to -3), extremely confined space (-2), intervening obstacles (-1 to -3), drunk (-2)', 'brawl'),
(11, 'Drive', 'physical', 'They took the turn with a screech of tires, coming out onto a deserted street. The pursuing pickup truck took the turn wide, riding up onto the far curb and flattening a mailbox before the driver got his vehicle under control.  “Hang on!” John said, hitting the brakes and pulling on the wheel. Jenny and Robert were thrown against the far doors as the Volvo spun and headed back the way it had come, right at the oncoming truck. John got a glimpse of the other driver’s shocked expression before the man swerved and the truck struck a fire hydrant.  Robert looked back at the wreck shrinking in the distance. “Holy shit,” he said, shaking his head. “Where did you learn to drive like that?”  John laughed. “Who says you can’t learn anything from The Dukes of Hazzard?”', 'The Drive Skill allows your character to operate a vehicle under difficult or dangerous conditions. Characters don’t need this Skill simply to drive a car. It’s safe to assume in a modern society that most individuals are familiar with automobiles and the rules of the road. Rather, this trait covers the training or experience necessary to operate at high speeds, to tackle hazardous road conditions and to push a vehicle to the limits of its performance. Drive is the difference between a typical suburban parent with a minivan and a police officer, car thief or racecar driver. (See “Handling” on p. 146 for dice-pool equipment modifiers for various vehicles.) The Skill also applies to piloting and controlling boats; your character’s Drive dots are applied equally to handling boats. In order for your character to be able to pilot a plane, he needs a Pilot Specialty in the Skill. With that, efforts to control a plane call for a Drive-based roll, plus one die for your character’s Pilot Specialty. A character with the Drive Skill who does not possess a Pilot Specialty cannot effectively operate a plane. His efforts to fly are based on Attribute alone, at a -1 untrained penalty.\r\n\r\nNote that dots in Drive do not apply to manually fixing or building vehicles, only to operating them. Construction and repair is the province of the Crafts Skill (see p. 57).\r\n\r\n**Possessed by:** Car thieves, couriers, delivery drivers, emergency responders, police officers, racecar drivers\r\n\r\n**Specialties:** High-Performance Cars, Motorcycles, Off-Road, Pursuit, Shaking Tails, Stunts\r\n\r\n#### Roll Results\r\n**Dramatic Failure:** Your character loses control of the vehicle while attempting a maneuver. If traveling at high speed, a crash occurs, wrecking the vehicle and likely injuring its occupants. If the local terrain presents no convenient obstacles (your character drives on an open a highway or salt flat), the car flips and rolls for some distance until it comes to a stop. If traveling at low speed, the vehicle sideswipes a parked car or tree, or possibly slides off the road and becomes stuck at the Storyteller’s discretion. See “Vehicles”, p. 141, for rules on how to handle vehicles and crashes.\\\r\n**Failure:** Your character doesn’t complete his intended maneuver. The direction the vehicle travels (if it goes anywhere at all) is determined by the Storyteller rather than by your character.\\\r\n**Success:** Your character completes his intended maneuver.\\\r\n**Exceptional Success:** Not only does your character complete his intended maneuver, he gains much more ground than expected. Perhaps he swerves around a sharp corner, drops perfectly into a sudden gap in traffic and shoots down the road.', 'drive'),
(12, 'Firearms', 'physical', 'Theodore Logan was a well-protected man. His hillside mansion was surrounded by a high stone wall, topped with barbed wire and sensitive motion detectors. Cameras covered every inch of his property. Armed guards patrolled the grounds 24 hours a day, accompanied by huge dogs. And then there was the fortress-like manor itself.  Simon checked the wind speed once more and noted it on his homemade range card. It had taken him almost a week to find the perfect vantage point on a hilltop nearly a mile from Logan’s property. From here, he had a clear view of the man’s heated pool. Logan was a creature of habit. He liked his nightly swim. And habits, as Simon had learned in sniper school, could get you killed.  Reaching into his pocket, Simon pulled out the heavy, silver-tipped bullet, carefully loaded the scope-sighted rifle, and raised the stock to his shoulder. The night-vision sight revealed the poolside in eerie shades of green. Logan was climbing from the pool as Simon settled the crosshairs over the man’s heart.', 'Firearms allows your character to identify, operate and maintain most types of guns, from pistols to rifles to military weapons such as submachine guns, assault rifles and machine guns. This Skill can represent the kind of formal training provided to police and the military, or the basic, hands-on experience common to hunters, criminals and gun enthusiasts.

The most common type of dramatic failure is a misfire — the bullet simply does not go off when the trigger is pulled, and your character is free to shoot again in the next turn. Other mechanical failures such as a jam can be cleared in the following turn.\\\r\n**Failure:** Your character misses his intended target. The Storyteller determines what, if anything, the bullet actually hits.\\\r\n**Success:** Your character hits his intended target. See Chapter 7 for details on inflicting damage with firearms.\\\r\n**Exceptional Success:** Not only does your character hit the target, he strikes a particularly vital area, magnifying the damage as reflected by your stellar roll.

His attempt at picking a mark’s pocket comes up empty, or the lock he works on refuses to cooperate.\\\r\n**Success:** Your character completes his action without arousing any notice or suspicion. He pockets the stolen wallet, slips inside the dark building or plucks the diamond from the nest of laser beams without anyone the wiser.\\\r\n**Exceptional Success:** Your character not only completes his action, he does so with exceptional speed and grace, saving precious seconds when time is of the essence.

John moved soundlessly down the hall, slower than he’d have preferred, but speed and silence simply didn’t mix.

It took a few minutes to reach the dark kitchen, and then he was through the door and gone with no one the wiser.', 'The Stealth Skill represents a character’s experience or training in avoiding notice, whether by moving silently, making use of cover or blending into a crowd. When attempting to sneak silently through an area or to use the local terrain as concealment, roll Dexterity + Stealth + equipment. When trying to remain unseen in a crowd, Wits + Stealth is appropriate. The Storyteller may make Stealth rolls secretly on your behalf, since your character usually has no way of knowing he’s been noticed until it’s too late. If your character attempts to avoid notice by a group of alert observers, a contested roll versus the observers’ Wits + Composure + equipment is required.\r\n\r\n**Possessed by:** Criminals, hunters, police officers, private investigators\r\n\r\n**Specialties:** Camouflage, Crowds, Moving in Darkness, Moving in Woods\r\n\r\n#### Roll Results\r\n**Dramatic Failure:** Your character not only fails to move stealthily, he does something to actively draw attention to himself. He steps on a branch or a broken bottle,or jostles someone in a crowd who protests loudly and angrily.\\\r\n**Failure:** Your character fails to move or act in a stealthy fashion. If potential observers get at least one success on a Wits + Composure roll, your character is busted.\\\r\n**Success:** Your character avoids notice if his successes exceed his opponents’.\\\r\n**Exceptional Success:** Your character, through a combination of luck and talent, finds just the right circum- stances to act virtually without being noticed for the turn.

He stopped at his first trout line and tested it. Sure enough, there was a good-sized fish twisting in the swift current. Simon smiled. He could last here as long as he had to.', 'Survival represents your character’s experience or training in “living off the land.” He knows where to find food and shelter, and how to endure harsh environmental conditions. The more capable your character is, the fewer resources he needs in order to prevail. A master survivalist can walk into a forest, desert or mountainous region with little more than a pocketknife and the clothes on his back and survive for weeks if necessary. Note that Survival is not synonymous with Animal Ken (see p. 78). The former helps your character stay alive in the wilderness, living off the land with whatever supplies he has brought with him. The latter involves understanding animal behavior and interacting directly with animals. Your character could be knowledgeable in creating shelter and gathering plants to eat (Survival), but might know nothing about anticipating the actions of a bear in his camp (Animal Ken).\r\n\r\n**Possessed by:** Explorers, hunters, soldiers, survivalists\r\n\r\n**Specialties:** Foraging, Navigation, Meteorology, Shelter\r\n\r\n#### Roll Results\r\n**Dramatic Failure:** Your character has made a false set of assumptions about his environment that puts him in danger.

She raised the umbrella point even with her assailant’s nose.  “What the fuck you think you’re going to do with that?” the man snarled, swiping at the umbrella with his free hand. His snarl turned to a shriek as Lydia flicked the umbrella under his hand and stabbed the metal point neatly through the mask’s right eye hole.', 'As the name implies, the Weaponry Skill represents your character’s experience or training in fighting with everything from beer bottles to pipes, knives to swords. While formal instruction in Weaponry is uncommon (restricted to military and law-enforcement training and a few martial arts), any character who has grown up on the street or spent a lot of time in seedy bars has had ample opportunity to learn this Skill.\r\n\r\nA character’s Weaponry is added to his Strength to stage armed attacks.

The red drops scattered across the leaves and ground leapt out to his trained eyes. Or they did until he reacted instinctively to a nearby sound. To Patrick’s surprise, a wolf emerged out of nowhere and barred his path. “It’s on the blood trail, too,” he thought. Then he reassured himself, “It’s alone. It won’t attack without its pack.” Or so he thought, until a malicious glimmer shone in the animal’s eye that Patrick had never seen before.', 'Anticipating and understanding human emotions is one thing, but being able to interpret and recognize the behavior of animals is something else entirely. Your character intuitively grasps or has been trained to read animals to know how they react to situations. The Skill also involves innately understanding how the animal mind operates, and what may appease or enrage beasts. The knack often coincides with a respect for animals, but it could derive from the analytical observation of a lab scientist or from years of abuse inflicted by a callous animal handler. Animal Ken could be applied to grasp the thoughts or intentions of supernatural animals, if the Storyteller allows.

He may, for example, interpret furiously energetic behavior as play- fulness rather than as a warning.\\\r\n**Failure:** Your character is unable to gauge the animal’s true state.\\\r\n**Success:** Your character has a good read on the animal’s true emotional state.\\\r\n**Exceptional Success:** Your character notes enough tell tale clues in the animal’s behavior to gain a detailed understanding of its state. Not only might he recognize that the animal is anxious, but that its offspring are nearby.', 'animalKen'),

She’s messed up pretty bad.”  Wagner headed for the car, stepping around the form splayed out on the asphalt, which was only partly covered by a blood-soaked tarp. He saw Dr. Feingold a few yards away, kneeling by the parked car, playing a small flashlight over what looked like a severed hand.  The girl was curled up in the fetal position in the back of the squad car, pulling a blanket around her shoulders as if it could shut out the world. There was matted blood — her fiancé’s blood — in her hair. Her white-knuckled hands trembled.

He may, for example, interpret nervous laughter as genu- ine, missing the anxiety and potential for violence that clumsy jokes attempt to hide.\\\r\n**Failure:** Your character is unable to gauge a subject’s true emotional state.\\\r\n**Success:** Your character has a good read on a person’s true emotional state, regardless of whatever front the subject puts up.\\\r\n**Exceptional Success:** Your character notes enough tell tale clues in a subject’s behavior to gain a detailed understanding of her emotional state.

Envious characters are never secure or content with their place in life. They always measure themselves against their rivals and look for ways to get what they deserve. They might be considered paranoid or just consumed by a self-loathing that they project onto others.\r\n\r\nYour character regains one Willpower point whenever she gains something important from a rival or has a hand in harming that rival’s wellbeing.\r\n\r\n**Example:** *Hughes watched the reporters, sponsors and women flock to Montgomery like moths to a flame. One-tenth of a second in the 40 meter and a couple slick moves on the field were all that made Hughes the low-paid fullback and Montgomery the star tailback.

(2, 'Gluttony', 'Gluttony is about indulging appetites to the exclusion of everything else. It’s about dedicating oneself to sensual pleasures or chasing the next high. A glutton makes any sacrifice to feed his insatiable appetite for pleasure, regardless of the cost to himself or those around him. He might be considered a junky or even a kleptomaniac (he steals things he doesn’t need just for the thrill of it).\r\n\r\nYour character regains one spent Willpower point whenever he indulges in his addiction or appetites at some risk to himself or a loved one.\r\n\r\n**Example:** *They’d come for his dad. They’d hauled his ass into the bedroom, brought in the power tools, and then the screaming started. James thought about protesting, but what good would it do? He decided to drown it all out, instead. He snorted some coke and tipped back the whiskey. Sure, he’d gotten involved with them, and maybe that was a mistake, but he told his dad to keep out of it. James took another drink. The whiskey trailed fire down his throat and dulled his senses. They didn’t tolerate people interfering in their business. And so, James took another drink.* \r\n\r\n*By overwhelming his senses with drugs and booze rather than helping his father, James indulges in his defining Vice and regains a point of spent Willpower.*\r\n\r\n**Other Names:** Addictive personality, conspicuous consumer, epicurean \r\n\r\n**Possessed by:** Celebrities, junkies, thieves'),

They want more — more money, a bigger house, more status or influence — no matter that they may already have more than they can possibly handle. Everything is taken to excess. To the greedy, there is no such thing as having too much. If that means snatching someone else’s hard-earned reward just to feather one’s own nest, well, that’s the way it goes.\r\n\r\nYour character regains one Willpower point whenever he acquires something at the expense of another. Gaining it must come at some potential risk (of assault, arrest or simple loss of peer respect).\r\n\r\n**Example:** *Gregor scanned down the list of names. It read like a small-town telephone book.

(4, 'Lust', 'The Vice of Lust is the sin of uncontrolled desire. A lusty individual is driven by a passion for something (usually sex, but it can be a craving for virtually any experience or activity) that he acts upon without consideration for the needs or feelings of others. A lusty individual uses any means at his disposal to indulge his desires, from deception to manipulation to acts of violence.\r\n\r\nYour character is consumed by a passion for something. He regains one Willpower point whenever he satisfies his lust or compulsion in a way that victimizes others.\r\n\r\n**Example:** *For two weeks, Aaron had been holed up with the star witness, “protecting” her. That she was also suspected as an accomplice in the crime hadn’t stopped Aaron from banging her seven ways to Sunday, ever since she’d come on to him on the second day. It might have meant compromising the witness and his career, but this chick was worth it. Aaron didn’t care that her last four husbands had died or that the precinct had labeled her “Black Widow.” The sex just kept getting better. In fact, he was exhausted for hours afterward. If he’d stopped to think about it, the blackouts might have worried him, but he didn’t want to think about it.*\r\n\r\n*By using his position and influence to get sexual favors, Aaron indulges in his defining Vice and regains a point of spent Willpower.*\r\n\r\n**Other Names:** Lasciviousness, impatience, impetuousness \r\n\r\n**Possessed by:** Movie producers, politicians, rock stars\r\n'),
(5, 'Pride', 'Pride is the Vice of self-confidence run amok. It is the belief that one’s every action is inherently right, even when it should be obvious that it is anything but. A prideful person refuses to back down when his decision or reputation is called into question, even when the evidence is clear that he is in the wrong. His ego does not accept any outcome that suggests fallibility, and he is willing to see others suffer rather than admit that he’s wrong.\r\n\r\nYour character regains one Willpower point whenever he exerts his own wants (not needs) over others at some potential risk to himself. This is most commonly the desire for adulation, but it could be the desire to make others do as he commands.\r\n\r\n**Example:** *Fabrice stepped out of his car and faced the old mansion. Four centuries of French weather had taken its toll on the once regal place. The setting sun stretched shadows across the façade, highlighting every flaw and crack, and throwing a distorted shadow over the front door like an evil omen.*\r\n\r\nHaunted indeed. \r\n\r\n*When the unkempt, ill-mannered student had shown up to his lecture and publicly challenged the professor to spend one night in the mansion, how could the foremost debunker of mystic nonsense decline?*\r\n\r\n*Fabrice was sure he had more to fear from the house collapsing than from evil spirits. Yes, he was quite sure.*\r\n\r\n*By refusing to back down to the challenge, and reveling in his own self-assurance, Fabrice indulges his defining Vice and regains a point of spent Willpower.*\r\n\r\n**Other Names:** Arrogance, ego complex, vanity\r\n**Possessed by:** Corporate executives, movie stars, street thugs\r\n'),
(6, 'Sloth', 'The Vice of Sloth is about avoiding work until someone else has to step in to get the job done. Rather than put in the effort — and possibly risk failure — in a difficult situation, the slothful person simply refuses to do anything, knowing that someone else will step in and fix the problem sooner or later. The fact that people might needlessly suffer while the slothful person sits on his thumbs doesn’t matter one bit.\r\n\r\nYour character regains one Willpower point whenever he successfully avoids a difficult task but achieves the same goal nonetheless.\r\n\r\n**Example:** *Catherine pretended to listen as the fourth tenant that day called to tell her, the superintendent, that the security lights were out. Some asshole had gone and broken all the lights around the apartment building.*\r\n\r\n*Sure, she’d heard stories about the Harcourt building, where the lights were shattered one night and there were break-ins the next. Depending on who was telling the story, some weird shit happened over there.*\r\n\r\n*But the afternoon soaps were starting, and Catherine decided the Harcourt stuff was just rumors. Besides, she had a baseball bat in case any boogey men came calling. She unplugged the phone and let her ass warm the couch. The lights could wait another day.*\r\n\r\n*By avoiding work despite the repercussions, Catherine indulges her defining Vice and regains a point of spent Willpower.*\r\n\r\n**Other Names:** Apathy, cowardice, ignorance\r\n \r\n**Possessed by:** Couch potatoes, trust-fund heirs, welfare cheats'),
(7, 'Wrath', 'The Vice of Wrath is the sin of uncontrolled anger. The wrathful look for ways to vent their anger and frustration on people or objects at the slightest provocation. In most cases the reaction is far out of proportion to the perceived slight. A wrathful person cut off on the freeway might try to force another driver off the road, or a wrathful cop might delight in beating each and every person he arrests, regardless of the offense.\r\n\r\nYour character regains one spent Willpower point whenever he unleashes his anger in a situation where doing so is dangerous. If the fight has already begun, no Willpower points are regained. It must take place in a situation where anger is unwarranted or inappropriate.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Example:** *As April staggered in, Rebecca surprised her at the door, demanding the month’s rent. April had gotten hooked on the new drug that had hit the streets. She had spent most of her time day-tripping and having paranoia attacks about “things eating through the walls of the world.” Rebecca didn’t care anymore, and when the usual litany of excuses began, Rebecca hit her. Blood ran from April’s nose and down her mouth.*\r\n\r\n*“I want... the damn... rent,” Rebecca yelled, punctuating each statement with another blow until April was on the ground, balled up and crying.* \r\n\r\n*By beating the money out of April, Rebecca indulges her defining Vice and regains a point of spent Willpower.*\r\n\r\n**Other Names:** Antisocial tendencies, hot-headedness, poor anger management, sadism\r\n\r\n**Possessed by:** Bullies, drill sergeants, street thugs');

(1, 'Charity', 'True Charity comes from sharing gifts with others, be it money or possessions, or simply giving time to help another in need. A charitable character is guided by her compassion to share what she has in order to improve the plight of those around her. Charitable individuals are guided by the principle of treating others as they would be treated themselves. By sharing gifts and taking on the role of the Samaritan, they hope to cultivate goodwill in others, and the gifts they give will eventually return to them in their hour of need.\r\n\r\nYour character regains all spent Willpower points whenever she helps another at the risk of loss or harm to herself. It isn’t enough to share what your character has in abundance. She must make a real sacrifice in terms of time, possessions or energy, or she must risk life and limb to help another.\r\n\r\n**Example:** *Deloris could see her dad losing his mind if he knew his little girl was driving around a south-side neighborhood so late at night. But if she wanted to be a top investigative reporter, she had to take some risks, even if it meant tracking down clues on a serial killer in a slum.*\r\n\r\n*She’d been the one to dub him “Tommy 10 Tongues” in her first cover story. Now he was up to 12 tongues, and she was determined to catch him before he harvested another. She knew the police had no idea how to decipher the bloody hieroglyphs at the crime scenes, or why the victims were all missing their tongues. But the police didn’t have an ex-lover who was a linguistics professor.*\r\n\r\n*Then Deloris passed the other motorist. A white man with a cast on one arm struggling to change a flat. If Tommy 10 Tongues didn’t get him, the locals surely would. And yet, Deloris wasn’t born yesterday. The cast could have been a fake. The killer could have used such tricks to lure his victims in. She didn’t want to be the next one, but she couldn’t bear the thought of writing the morning headline, “Stranded Motorist 13th Victim.” So, she pulled over to do the charitable thing.*\r\n\r\n*Deloris gains all spent Willpower for her act of charity. Her willingness to risk herself for someone else validates her defining Virtue.*\r\n\r\n**Other Names:** Compassion, mercy \r\n\r\n**Possessed by:** Philanthropists, saints, soup-kitchen workers'),
(2, 'Faith', 'Those with Faith know that the universe is not random, meaningless chaos, but ordered by a higher power. No matter how horrifying the world might be, everything has its place in the Plan and ultimately serves that Purpose. This Virtue does not necessarily involve belief in a personified deity. It might involve belief in a Grand Unified Theory whereby the seeming randomness of the universe is ultimately an expression of mathematical precision. Or it might be a view that everything is One and that even evil is indistinguishable from good when all discriminating illusions are overcome.\r\n\r\nYour character regains all spent Willpower points whenever he is able to forge meaning from chaos and tragedy.\r\n\r\n**Example:** *Kevin stood at a precipice. Images flashed through his mind: his wife’s bulging eyes, his son’s mutilated body, his daughter’s pink pajamas shredded and matted with hair and blood. Despair and rage whirled up from the psychological chasm before him. He had only to take a step into the cold comfort that the world was meaningless, random and violent, that there could be no God if such evil could come to pass.*\r\n\r\n*No! He didn’t believe it. He couldn’t believe it. Something had done this. Something sick and twisted. Something inhuman. Kevin would find it. God give him strength, he would find it and stop it.*\r\n\r\n*By dedicating himself to finding the meaning of the crime, knowing that there must be a reason for the madness, Kevin regains any spent Willpower points.*\r\n\r\n**Other Names:** Belief, conviction, humility, loyalty\r\n\r\n**Possessed by:** Detectives, philosophers, priests, scientists, true believers'),
(3, 'Fortitude', 'A person’s ideals are meaningless unless they’re tested. When it seems as though the entire world is arrayed against him because of his beliefs, a person possessing Fortitude weathers the storm and emerges with his convictions intact. Fortitude is about standing up for one’s beliefs and holding the course no matter how tempting it may be to relent or give up. By staying the course — regardless of the cost — he proves the worth of his ideals.\r\n\r\nYour character regains all spent Willpower points whenever he withstands overwhelming or tempting pressure to alter his goals. This does not include temporary distractions from his course of action, only pressure that might cause him to abandon or change his goals altogether.\r\n\r\n**Example:** *Noel was absorbed in reading the newspaper when the stranger walked in. The town was opening its eyes to the corruption; his campaign to oust the criminal who called himself ‘mayor’ was working.*\r\n\r\n*The stranger dropped some photos on the desk, breaking Noel’s concentration. They were of Noel 15 years before. The alcoholic years. “I suggest you drop your high and mighty crusade unless you want these on the front page.” Noel instantly recognized that his political career hung in the balance. Was this how it started? Was this how they got their hooks into you?*\r\n\r\n*“Run them,” he said. “I don’t care. You can tell your boss he’s through. He has more to lose than I do.”*\r\n\r\n*By refusing to budge and pressing on in the wake of scandal, Noel behaves in a way that validates his defining Virtue and he regains any spent Willpower points.*\r\n\r\n**Other Names:** Courage, integrity, mettle, stoicism\r\n\r\n**Possessed by:** Dictators, fanatic cultists, gumshoes'),
(4, 'Hope', 'Being hopeful means believing that evil and misfortune cannot prevail, no matter how grim things become. Not only do the hopeful believe in the ultimate triumph of morality and decency over malevolence, they maintain steadfast belief in a greater sense of cosmic justice — whether it’s Karma or the idea of an all-knowing, all-seeing God who waits to punish the wicked. All will turn out right in the end, and the hopeful mean to be around when it happens.\r\n\r\nYour character regains all spent Willpower points whenever she refuses to let others give in to despair, even though doing so risks harming her own goals or wellbeing. This is similar to Fortitude, above, except that your character tries to prevent others from losing hope in their goals. She need not share those goals herself or even be successful in upholding them, but there must be a risk involved.\r\n\r\n**Example:** *The activists’ anger was palpable as Eva entered the room.*\r\n\r\n*“I know you see me as the enemy — Trent Thorson’s daughter. The truth is, I may own Thorson Lumber, but I don’t control it or I’d shut it down. If my uncle has his way, I’ll never have that chance.*\r\n\r\n*“I know his lawyers and thugs are pressuring you to stop the protest, but you can’t give up. You feel the power of that forest. There’s something there, something bigger than any of us that needs to be protected.*\r\n\r\n*“All I came here to say is don’t lose hope. I’ll feed you what information I can from the inside to keep you one step ahead of them. If you give up now, there’ll be nothing left to save.”*\r\n\r\n*By supporting the activists at her own personal expense and risk, Eva regains any spent Willpower.*\r\n\r\n**Other Names:** Dreamer, optimist, utopian\r\n\r\n**Possessed by:** Anti-globalization activists, entrepreneurs, martyrs, visionaries'),
(5, 'Justice', 'Wrongs cannot go unpunished. This is the central tenet of the just, who believe that protecting the innocent and confronting inequity is the responsibility of every decent person, even in the face of great personal danger. The just believe that evil cannot prosper so long as one good person strives to do what is right, regardless of the consequences.\r\n\r\nYour character regains all spent Willpower points whenever he does the right thing at risk of personal loss or setback. The “right thing” can be defined by the letter or spirit of a particular code of conduct, whether it be the United States penal code or a biblical Commandment.\r\n\r\n**Example:** *For five years Malcolm watched the bastard parade into court, smiling through appeal after appeal. His gold-plated lawyers ran circles around the district attorney. Then they settled the class-action suit at such a ridiculously low payment that Malcolm had to wonder how far the bribes went. And the bastard was going free.*\r\n\r\n*Hundreds had been driven insane by the drug he distributed. It made him rich even while it made Malcolm’s sister a corpse... and then a ghost. It was only then that Malcolm realized why she always appeared outside his hall closet. That’s where he kept his gun.*\r\n\r\n*If Malcolm takes the law into his own hands and makes himself a criminal as a result, he acts in a way that validates his defining Virtue and he regains any spent Willpower.*\r\n\r\n**Other Names:** Condemnatory, righteous\r\n\r\n**Possessed by:** Critics, judges, parents, role models'),
(6, 'Prudence', 'The Virtue of Prudence places wisdom and restraint above rash action and thoughtless behavior. One maintains integrity and principles by moderating actions and avoiding unnecessary risks. While that means a prudent person might never take big gambles that bring huge rewards, neither is his life ruined by a bad roll of the dice. By choosing wisely and avoiding the easy road he prospers slowly but surely.\r\n\r\nYour character regains all spent Willpower points whenever he refuses a tempting course of action by which he could gain significantly. The “temptation” must involve some reward that, by refusing it, might cost him later on.\r\n\r\n**Example:** *“Miss Hernandez, you’re an intelligent woman — and a beautiful one, I might add. There are so many benefits available to the people who contribute to our family business. The least of them is the considerable fee we’re offering for your services in this matter.”*\r\n\r\n*“Your offer is generous,” Louise replied, “and I thank you for it. But the types of offshore transactions you propose are tantamount to money laundering and tax evasion. It wouldn’t be prudent for me to jeopardize my legal career by being party to this.”*\r\n\r\n*“You think you know, Miss Hernandez, but I assure you, you have no idea what you’re passing up.”*\r\n\r\n*If Louise passes on the possibility of riches to preserve her job and name, she acts in a way that validates her defining Virtue and regains any spent Willpower.*\r\n\r\n**Other Names:** Patience, vigilance\r\n**Possessed by:** Businessmen, doctors, priests, scientists'),
(7, 'Temperance', 'Moderation in all things is the secret to happiness, so says the doctrine of Temperance. It’s all about balance. Everything has its place in a person’s life, from anger to forgiveness, lust to chastity. The temperate do not believe in denying their urges, as none of it is unnatural or unholy. The trouble comes when things are taken to excess, whether it’s a noble or base impulse. Too much righteousness can be just as bad as too much wickedness.\r\n\r\nYour character regains all spent Willpower when he resists a temptation to indulge in an excess of any behavior, whether good or bad, despite the obvious rewards it might offer.\r\n\r\n**Example:** *Michael pressed Ravera to the pavement and cuffed him. For half his years on the force, Michael had been trying to bring Douglas Ravera to justice.*\r\n\r\n*How many kids had died from Ravera’s peddled junk? How many times had Michael’s family received death threats? How many times had Ravera been collared only to walk on a technicality?*\r\n\r\n*Michael’s mind kept turning back to the unregistered .38 stashed in his patrol car. He could fire some rounds into the car door and put Ravera’s prints on the weapon. Who would doubt that Michael had to kill him in self-defense?*\r\n\r\n*“No,” Michael muttered to himself. He couldn’t lower himself to the same level as this criminal, no matter how tempting. He’d be no better. Instead, he hauled Ravera into the back of the car and slammed the door.*\r\n\r\n*By refusing to give in to extreme and compelling impulses, remaining centered instead, Michael acts in a way that validates his defining Virtue and he regains any spent Willpower.*\r\n\r\n**Other Names:** Chastity, even-temperament, frugality\r\n**Possessed by:** Clergy, police officers, social workers');
