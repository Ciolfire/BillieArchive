Intelligence is a direct measure of how smart your character is. She may be dull-minded or have narrow-vision. She may be book-smart, or she may simply be able to grasp concepts, interpret situations and solve problems quickly. Intelligence is valued by planners, theorists, scholars, white-collar employees and leaders.', '“I’m sick of this,” Becky announced in frustration. She immediately regretted her outburst as her words echoed throughout the musty old library. Fortunately, this late at night, even during exams, no one else was there to hear. She had been working on her thesis for weeks without getting anywhere. Once again, she wondered if a degree in Linguistics was a good choice.\r\n\r\nHer research was simply not panning out as she hoped, but after another pep talk, she forced herself back into the stacks. What other choice did she have? It was when reaching for a book on Sanskrit that she made her real discovery. A dusty old volume that seemed to have fallen between bookcases. It was bound in leather — or something like it — and had no publication date. Indeed, the book was nothing like she had ever seen before. No end papers. No table of contents. It just launched into some strange text.\r\n\r\nThe next thing she knew, Becky had passed hours studying the book. It had characters reminiscent of Latin and Greek, yet different, with odd pictographs throughout. As near as she could tell, it was dedicated to a religion or to ceremonies of some kind, but from what culture she had no idea. She did know that if she was ever going to find out, she would need more time with it.', 'intelligence'),

W its also encompasses an eye for detail, the ability to absorb what’s going on in the environment, and to react to events. It might mean recognizing that the temperature in a room slowly drops, that a landscape painting incorporates a disguised human face, or that a trap is about to be sprung. Wits involves the powers of perception and response. Your character may be oblivious, dumbfounded, quick-eyed or wary. The trait is useful for entrepreneurs, charlatans, athletes, tacticians, lawyers and criminals.', 'Martin had accepted some weird jobs, but this one took the cake. He’d installed or repaired plumbing across the city. He liked the work; jobs could be challenging and fun. Busting open drywall and messing with pipes was like tinkering with the skeleton of a building. You got to see straight into people’s private worlds. Sometimes you even got to peek at the skeletons in their closets. \r\n\r\nBut why be hired to do a full re-pipe at this place and be told not to go on the top floor? Martin had to know. So, when the greasy guy who hired him caught him at the top of the stairs, Martin had to think fast.\r\n\r\n“Yeah, I tried to find you. It’s uh... it’s what I was afraid of. An old building like this, the fittings have given way from wood rot or something. We’re, uh... we’re gonna need to re-route all the pipes upstairs instead of running the same lines.”\r\n\r\nDamn, that was good, he thought. Might be able to squeeze some extra bucks out of this job. The other man didn’t seem convinced.', 'wits'),

Resolve is your character’s mental fortitude. His personal conviction. His clarity of vision or spirit. Your character may be easily distracted, unable to concentrate, resolute or single-minded. The trait is pivotal to resisting supernatural forms of mental control; it acts as a veritable defense of the mind. Resolve is valuable to leaders, motivators, soldiers, athletes, police and organizers.\r\n\r\n(Note: Resolve is not to be confused with Willpower. Resolve is your character’s ongoing focus. Think of it as his long-term purpose, like a career plan. Willpower reflects your character’s short-term highs and lows, his ability to dedicate himself in brief efforts to overcome challenges. Resolve does contribute to your character’s Willpower dots, though)', 'Josh only really came to his senses when he threw up in the toilet. He had been conscious the whole time, he knew, but it was like he’d been in a daze, walking around like a zombie. He thought back to how it all happened. He’d left his apartment a few hours ago to run errands. It was a nice enough day for winter. He’d gotten some groceries, and then...\r\n\r\nAll he could remember was a blur. Something was there. Big. Strange. He remembered eyes, like an animal’s. They stared straight into his soul in a weird, almost primitive way. It was like his lizard brain kicked in and told him to run and hide, like a rabbit under the shadow of a hawk.\r\n\r\nJosh had a fleeting glimpse of the oranges he’d just bought rolling across the sidewalk, and then all he knew was being back in his apartment, getting sick. How did he get there? Why did he come back? How come he couldn’t remember? And what was that thing? Josh wasn’t sure, but he wasn’t content to let it go, either.\r\n', 'resolve'),

This trait is instrumental to laborers, thugs, athletes, brawlers and law-enforcement agents.\n\nStrength, along with Dexterity, is a factor in determining your character’s Speed.\n\nStrength is also added to Brawl or Weaponry attacks to determine the amount of harm your character inflicts in combat.', '“God damn,” Martin grunted as he pulled on the drain cover in the basement. Somehow, water was still backing up in the system. Everything else checked out, so it had to be a clog in the outtake to the sewer.\r\n\r\nThe building was so old that it still had a dirt-floor basement, yet the drain cover was stuck like a son of a bitch.\r\n\r\n“I could dig around it,” Martin thought, “but that would take time.” This was the last place he wanted to be pulling late hours. The whole building and the guy who hired him really gave him the creeps. It was like the guy resented Martin being there, as if the plumber was intruding on something the guy wanted for himself.\r\n\r\n“Fuck it,” Martin thought, and went to his truck to get a crowbar. Jamming it between grilles, he pried with everything he had. He pushed so hard he thought he was going to piss himself, when the cover cracked loose with a clang.\r\n\r\nAiming his flashlight down the hole, Martin saw something he couldn’t explain. Like a man who’d done this work for years, he reached down the pipe to his shoulder. When he pulled his arm free, his hand was coated red.', 'strength'),

While high Wits dots helps your character spot trouble, high Dexterity dots help him react to it, whether with a counteraction or to simply get the hell out of the way. Dexterity also helps with hand-eye coordination, be it to fire an accurate shot, to juggle objects or to perform delicate jobs such as handle explosives. Your character might be sluggish, clumsy, slight, quick or nimble. Dexterity is invaluable to criminals, sports stars, surgeons and dancers.\r\n\r\nDexterity, along with Strength, is a factor in determining your character’s Speed.\r\n\r\nDexterity is also combined with Composure to determine your character’s Initiative in a fight.', 'Josh had retraced his steps back to where he fell, to where he saw that thing. He turned on the sidewalk, surveying his neighborhood. It wasn’t the best place to live, but he couldn’t afford any better. The worst of it was the bums and homeless, but they left him alone if he gave them some change.\r\n\r\nJosh snapped out of his daydream and realized that he’d been staring glassy-eyed at the alley across the street. There was something about it. He shook his head to clear it and waited for a couple cars to pass.\r\n\r\nThe alley lay between rundown tenements and ran past an old parking lot. No one parked there anymore. Cardboard boxes and scattered blankets used by bums blocked the way. Josh almost turned back, not wanting to piss off the street people, but then he remembered how angry he got back home.\r\n\r\nHe steeled himself and headed down the alley. Almost immediately, open hands reached out from what looked like heaps of trash or discarded clothing as the homeless muttered for money. After a moment, their pleas turned to angry shouts as Josh ventured further into their territory. Panicking, Josh jumped up the chain-link fence next to him. It was the closest escape route. He wished he hadn’t when he got to the barbwire at the top, but forced himself upward and over. He didn’t quite make it, and the rusted steel tore through his pants and into his leg.', 'dexterity'),
(6, 'stamina', 'physical', 'resistance', 'Sturdiness. Steadfastness. Sheer physical resilience. Stamina is a measure of how tough your character is. It indicates how far she can push her body, and how much physical abuse she can endure. Your character might be sickly and frail, or hardy and unstoppable. Bouncers, brawlers, triathletes, survivalists, heavy lifters and workaholics thrive on Stamina.\r\n\r\nStamina, along with Size, is a factor in determining your character’s Health dots.', 'Becky thanked the pizza guy absently as she closed her apartment door. His nose wrinkled in distaste, not because she failed to tip him but because of the smell of her room, because of her greasy hair and because of her clearly unwashed appearance.\r\n\r\nBecky never noticed the silent insult. She hadn’t really noticed anything for weeks. In fact, eating had become something that she had to remind herself to do. Now it was the book that consumed her. Even as she pushed aside scattered and wadded up papers to sit down, she kept her nose in the book. It demanded every ounce of her attention. Translating and understanding it had become her obsession. It superceded sleep, food, even her thesis. At first, she hoped the book would be invaluable to her research. Now she pored over it for its own sake. If she kept studying, kept interpreting. She knew comprehension would come. As the night wore on, Becky continued to work. The pizza box went unopened.', 'stamina'),
(7, 'presence', 'social', 'power', 'Bearing. Stature. Assertiveness. Presence suggests the power of your character’s very identity. Attractiveness is only part of the trait. Your character may be jaw-dropping gorgeous, plain-Jane or downright ugly, but her Presence means much more. It reflects her sheer command over the attention of others. It’s her capacity to impose her will on others by being socially aggressive or powerful — a veritable bull in a china shop or someone who simply doesn’t accept no for an answer. This trait is essential to leaders, enforcers, interrogators, models, politicians and salespeople.\r\n\r\nNote that attractiveness alone is represented by the Striking Looks Merit, which grants bonus dice to Presence rolls.', 'Martin was stunned. He wasn’t sure how long he stared at the blood on his hand, bewildered by what it might mean. Was the guy who owned the place some kind of psycho, killing people and pouring their blood down the drain? He wasn’t sure, but he finally decided that he didn’t want to find out. It was weird, though. It was like he couldn’t think straight. This should have scared the shit out of him, and here he was kind of out of it, like he’d had a few.\r\n\r\nWhen he got upstairs, he realized the lights were on. It was already dusk outside, given the last light coming in through the windows. “When did that happen,” he wondered. “I meant to—” \r\n\r\nHis thought went unfinished. Standing before him at the foot of the stairs was the most beautiful woman he’d ever seen. Normally, he didn’t go for brunettes. They reminded him of his ex-, but somehow this one made it work. Did she ever. \r\n\r\n“What was I doing?” Martin muttered, but no answer came.\r\n\r\nThe woman’s dark eyes contrasted her pale skin, and focused intently on the blood on Martin’s hand, on the blood that he’d absently smeared across his shirt.\r\n\r\n“Did you hurt yourself?” the woman asked. “Here, let me make it better.”\r\n', 'presence'),
(8, 'manipulation', 'social', 'finesse', 'Charm. Persuasiveness. Charisma. The capacity to play upon the desires, hopes and needs of others to influence them. Manipulation reflects your character’s finesse in social situations. How well he can appeal to, gain the favor of and generally coerce others. Manipulation is applied to win smiles, to put people at ease or to gain favors. Where Presence deals in social force, Manipulation focuses on social subtlety. It’s the tool and trade of businesspeople, politicians, salesfolk and publicists. Your character may be a wallflower, he could frequently make off-color statements, he might have a winning smile and a hardy handshake, or he may be able to sell sand in the desert.', '“What the fuck am I doing?” Josh wondered as he picked his way down the trash-strewn hallway. “This is exactly where I didn’t want to go.”\r\n\r\nHe had evaded the homeless people in the alley, but then had nowhere to go except into one of the old tenements. His leg burned from the long scratches the fence left him. He hoped his tetanus shot was up to date; he couldn’t remember. The place smelled like piss. He could hear music blaring somewhere, and a baby crying. “Who could raise a kid here?” he wondered.\r\n\r\nHe didn’t have time to think about the answer, though. His eyes were suddenly drawn from the stained carpet to the light at the end of the hall. Three shapes filled it. Two more turned the corner behind him. They were the people from outside. Maybe they weren’t so homeless, after all.\r\n\r\nOn the verge of panic once again, Josh recognized one of the men. “Hey, Eddy, it’s me, Josh. What’s going on?”\r\n\r\nThe five dirty, disheveled men stopped a few feet away, with menacing looks on their faces. “What are you doing here, Josh?” Eddy asked. “I was looking for somethi— a guy. I thought I saw him go in here. Maybe you could help me find him? I think I got a couple bucks....”\r\n\r\n“We don’t want your fucking money.” For a second, Josh wondered if he saw that same bestial look that he’d seen earlier that day — but this time in Eddy’s eyes.', 'manipulation'),
(9, 'composure', 'social', 'resistance', 'Poise. Dignity. The capacity to remain calm and appear — and actually be — unfazed in social and threatening situations, usually harrowing ones. Your character might lose his temper at the slightest perceived insult, collapse emotionally under a mere pretense, weather a storm of verbal (or literal) slings and arrows, or have the nerve to look unspeakable horror in the eye. This trait is a measure of emotional fortitude, restraint and calm. It’s ideal among leaders, soldiers, moderators and anyone whose movements are public consumption. Composure is vital to resisting social influence and pressure — overt, covert or otherworldly.\r\n\r\nComposure is pivotal to resisting supernatural forms of emotional control; it acts as a veritable emotional defense. The trait is also vital to efforts among supernatural beings such as vampires and werewolves to restrain themselves when their blood is raised and frenzy threatens.\r\n\r\nComposure, along with Resolve, is a factor in determining your character’ s Willpower.\r\n\r\nComposure is also added to Dexterity to determine your character’s Initiative at the beginning of a fight.', '“Do you understand now?” the priest asked.\r\n\r\nBecky was in shock. Moments before, she’d stormed to her door, ready to unleash her frustration on whomever had dared to interrupt her. Her research had not gone well. The meaning or purpose of the book still eluded her, and she was at the end of her rope.\r\n\r\nOnce she recovered sufficiently from the shock of finding a priest at her door, she answered. “What?”\r\n\r\n“Do you understand now? About the book? About what it says?” Becky continued her look of disbelief. How could this perfect stranger — and a man of the cloth — know anything about her, or more importantly the book?\r\n\r\n“I see,” he continued as he let himself in and shut the door.\r\n\r\nBecky didn’t object. She could scarcely complete a thought.\r\n\r\n“You might be confused. I understand. Rest assured, though, you’re the one. The book chose you. It knows you’re ready. Well, almost. That’s why I’m here. I’m here to help open your eyes.” And with that, everything Becky had stared at and studied moved about in her mind like the pieces of a puzzle. They spun, crisscrossed and overlapped — and finally formed a complete picture. Looking at it was like looking at the sun. It was like staring into the void and knowing that the void stared back. In that moment, Becky’s mind snapped.', 'composure');

We kept playing our games, doing our dance, but everyone was afraid that one AIDS-ridden blood doll with a grudge or one neonate with a personal computer and a private investor would decide someday to pull the trigger and make the world burn.*\n\n*Those were good times.*\n\n— Robyn Sloane, Circle of the Crone\n\nThis *full-color* PDF includes:\n\n- A brief historical look at America in the 1980s, from a Kindred perspective.\n- Player and Storyteller advice on chronicles set in this time period.\n- A Storytelling Adventure System story set in 1983 Chicago, complete with a pre-generated coterie.\n- A customized blank character sheet, and a black and white version of the full PDF for ease of printing.'),

Enfant brillante elle s’épanouit entourée de l\'amour de ses parents et d\'amis.\n\nCependant son train-train quotidien prit brusquement fin le 18 juin 1994 lorsque ses parents furent retrouvés assassinés dans leur voiture. Le meurtre du procureur et de sa femme provoquèrent un violent battage médiatique et la police déploya des ressources considérable afin d\'élucider l\'affaire.\n\n> ==== EXTRAIT DU RAPPORT DE POLICE ====\n> \n> La famille Sanders revenait d\'une soirée au cinéma Prytania dans lequel la famille avait ses habitudes. Un film d\'animation était projeté ce soir là, Le Roi Lion, et les Sanders quittèrent\n> \n> le parking du cinéma à 9h03. Un appel anonyme fut reçu à 9h37 indiquant qu\'une voiture était immobilisée au milieu de la chaussée au 4849 Laurel St et que le conducteur semblait\n> \n> inconscient. A l\'arrivée des agents ils constatèrent que monsieur et madame Sanders avaient été violemment agressés à l\'aide d\'une arme blanche; vraisemblablement une machette. Le véhicule semblait à l\'arrêt lors du drame mais ne présentait aucun signe d\'effraction. Vraisemblablement le tueur n\'était pas caché dans le véhicule car l\'enfant fut retrouvée cachée sous la banquette arrière, inconsciente et fut prise en charge immédiatement. Elle n\'a malheureusement pas été en mesure de nous apporter des informations, bien qu\'il soit évident qu\'elle ait assisté à la scène le choc psychologique a provoqué une perte des souvenirs de la journée. L\'enquête de la scène du crime n\'a pas apporté davantage d\'informations supplémentaires et il nous a été impossible de déterminer pourquoi le véhicule se trouvait si loin du trajet entre le cinéma et le domicile.\n> \n> ======================================\n\nAu fil des mois l\'enquête ne fit aucun progrès malgré les efforts conséquents déployés par les forces de l\'ordre. Aucun témoin, aucune trace du passage de la voiture sur les caméras de surveillance, et les anciens condamnés pouvant vouloir se venger ayant tous un alibi. Quant à Anastasia elle n\'aura jamais retrouvé ses souvenirs de la terrible journée et bien qu\'elle ait indiqué que son père semblait agité et anxieux au cours des derniers jours aucune piste n\'en ressortit, malgré des fouilles extensives du domicile familial.\n\nLa jeune fille étant désormais orpheline, la police contacta le membre de sa famille le plus proche, le frère de son père, Dan Sanders, qui accepta de s\'occuper d’elle. Celui-ci\n\nvivait de ses revenus modestes, travaillant dans un petit magasin d\'électronique et bien que lui et son frère se soient peu vus au cours des dernières années ils avaient toujours été\n\nEn bon termes. C\'est ainsi qu\'une nouvelle étape de la vie d\'Anastasia démarra dans le quartier de St Claude.\n\nProfondément affectée par la perte de ses parents elle se réfugie dans un mutisme et un isolement qui laissèrent Dan décontenancé et incapable de se lier à la fillette. Célibataire endurci, gros fumeur et sans la moindre idée de comment s\'occuper d\'un enfant, il finit par abandonner ses tentatives et retourna à sa routine habituelle, laissant la gamine à ses propres occupations et se concentrant sur sa deuxième identité, le pirate informatique connu sous le pseudonyme de Merlin.\n\nUn soir d\'octobre 1994 Dan se rend finalement compte d\'un changement dans le comportement D\'Anastasia, celle-ci l\'observe et semble intriguée par ses activités sur l\'ordinateur. Voyant là une chance de tisser des liens avec sa nièce il l\'encourager, avec succès, à découvrir les joies de l\'informatique et se montre un professeur patient et efficace.\n\nEn parallèle Anastasia reprend l\'école mais, toujours bouleversée par l\'événement, éprouve des difficultés à se concentrer et se distance de ses amies. La situation ne s\'améliore que\n\nlégèrement au cours de l\'année mais alors que vient le moment de la réinscription Dan a la mauvaise surprise d\'apprendre qu\'il lui est impossible d\'utiliser les fonds de son frère pour payer la scolarité de sa nièce. Ne pouvant s\'acquitter par lui-même des frais exorbitants de McGehee il se décide à inscrire Billie a l\'ecole publique William Franz. Toujours plus seule, la jeune fille s’obstine dans son isolement ce qui finit par décourager les autres enfants. Parfaitement à l\'aise dans sa solitude, ce n\'est que derriere un ecran qu\'Anastasia se sent vivre, découvrant les prémices du web. Copiant innocemment son oncle, elle se développe une nouvelle identité qu\'elle nomme Billie.\n\nDès septembre 1996 Anastasia entre au collège Bishop Perry, toujours solitaire et se concentrant sur les cours elle vit une existence banale jusqu\'au jour où Winston Reese fait irruption dans sa vie, décidant de s\'intéresser à cette jeune fille discrète, et a force de persévérance devient finalement son ami. Il découvre et accepte la passion de Billy pour l\'informatique, et l\'encourage à traîner avec lui dans le quartier. Le temps passe Et Billie s\'intègre progressivement dans le cercle d\'amis de Winston, faisant les 400 coups avec eux lorsqu\'elle n\'est pas scotchée sur son clavier.\n\nLes années passent et Billie développe un intérêt grandissant pour les informations douteuses et underground sur lesquelles elle tombe dans les recoins les plus sombres du net, les différentes informations sur les nombreux complots pullulant sur le dark web deviennent une obsession pour elle mais la difficulté à les obtenir la pousse à approfondir ses talents informatiques, et notamment en hacking. Traînant régulièrement avec Winston, qui devient de plus en endurci, elle est initiée très jeune à l\'alcool et aux drogues douces, dans lesquels elle plonge brièvement y trouvant là une source de plaisir et de confort dans un monde qu\'elle trouve sombre et déprimant.\n\nEn 1999 elle intègre le lycée John McDonogh. Winston ayant quitté le système scolaire son influence sur Billie se fait moins forte, ce qui l\'amène à se concentrer à nouveau sur ses études qu’elle avait quelque peu délaissées. Ses notes s\'améliorent notablement et elle se retrouve rapidement en tête de classe. Malheureusement certains de ses camarades n\'apprécient pas son attitude de \"nerd\" et décident de la harceler. Insultes et dénigrement quotidiens, dégradations de ses affaires et parfois même violence physique la poussent encore plus dans ses retranchements. C\'est à ce moment que Jacob Pool l\'aborde. Charmant, social et visiblement intéressé, il fait cesser le harcèlement et l\'intègre dans son groupe d\'amis. Ils se rapprochent alors et, malgré les réticences initiales de\n\nBillie, finissent par sortir ensemble le 15 avril 2001. C\'est la semaine suivante, en revenant d\'une fête qu\'elle perd sa virginité. Complètement dominée par l\'extase de l\'acte elle ne\n\nremarque pas tout de suite le changement de comportement de Jacob, et c\'est avec un sourire narquois que celui-ci mets fin à leur relation quelque jours plus tard, ayant accompli son but.\n\nTrahie et profondement blessee, Billie, qui ne se rends plus en cours, se réfugie à nouveau dans le net et y passe ses journées sous l’alias \"La Fée Morgane\", hacker qui\n\nse fait rapidement un nom au sein du dark web. Elle finit par rencontrer Perséphone, qui l\'invite dans le chan IRC d\'Hadès, repaire d\'un groupe de 12 hackers se faisant justice eux même en traquant des réseaux illégaux de toutes sortes afin de dévoiler leurs agissements aux autorités. Au fil des années, les dossiers de Billie sur les différents complots ont prit de l\'ampleur et c\'est par chance qu\'elle tombe sur un vieil article concernant l\'événement qui a coûté la vie à ses parents. Provenant d\'un magazine peu fiable sur le surnaturel celui-ci fait référence à l\'absence de toutes traces et évoque une possession par un esprit du malin. Ébranlée et sa curiosité piquée à vif, Billie épluche toutes les informations qu\'elle peut trouver, ayant confié à Perséphone sa véritable identité celle-ci l’appuie dans ses recherches, mais même son aide et celle de Merlin ne suffiront pas à percer le mystère qui semblera s\'épaissir et c\'est avec frustration et dégoût que Billie se rend compte qu\'il lui est pour le moment impossible de percer ce secret.\n\nCherchant une source de réconfort, Billie recontacte alors Winston, qui entre temps a rejoint un gang affilié aux Bloods. Celui-ci l\'entraîne dans des boites de nuits undergrounds et des\n\nbars louches, ou elle replonge dans ses travers d\'alcool et d\'herbes. Mais cela ne suffit pas à combler ce vide qu\'elle ressent, et repensant à son aventure avec Jacob elle se met à\n\ncoucher régulièrement avec des hommes toujours differents, cherchant le plaisir et a oublier la douleur de la trahison. Plutot mignonne, malgré son apparence négligée, Billie rentre\n\nrarement seule, montrant une agressivité qui jure avec son attitude effacée et calme habituelle.\n\nEn dehors de sa vie nocturne, la jeune fille, qui a totalement abandonné ses études, sort peu, restant collée pendant des heures devant son ordinateur occupée par ses propres recherches, celles au nom d\'Hydra et les petits jobs qu\'elle accepte. Il s’agit principalement d\'enquêtes pour des détectives privés sachant les informations protégées ou inaccessibles par des moyens usuels. S\'étant attiré une solide réputation pour son sérieux, son efficacité et sa discrétion, ses clients, bien que peu nombreux, sont réguliers et payent généreusement ce qui lui permet de vivre convenablement tout en aidant son oncle.\n\nAujourd\'hui, Billie vit toujours chez son oncle Dan, et bien qu\'ils n\'aient jamais réussi à devenir réellement proche, chacun accepte et apprécie la présence de l\'autre. Son travail de hacker la passionne et l\'occupe la majorité du temps, bien qu\'elle maintienne des contacts plus ou moins réguliers avec Winston. Elle a également pris l\'habitude de sortir occasionnellement, satisfaisant ses pulsions sociales et sexuelles.\n\nGlobalement, Billie est plutôt satisfaite de sa vie actuelle, bien qu\'elle s\'inquiète de plus en plus des faits qu\'elle collecte concernant les manigances dans l\'ombre d\'acteurs qu\'elle\n\nest incapable d\'identifier, elle est en tout cas bien decidee a mettre a jour les complots qui se trament dans l\'ombre.', '{\"1668608514\": {\"skill.crafts\": {\"info\": {\"id\": \"skill.crafts\", \"min\": 1, \"cost\": 0, \"name\": \"Crafts\", \"value\": 2}, \"type\":

When the rest of them come, they’ll feast on us raw and writhing in their mouths. The fact that you’re still alive is a gift. A gift we gave you. Be thankful.” “We’re doing more with your flesh than you were. We’re changing the world and you want to change it back?” “Kill me and you suffered for no reason at all.”\n\n**Background:** She’s always been too smart for her own good — or anyone else’s. Her father said she was brilliant; her mother said she was a slut who should learn how to act like a lady. It’s no wonder she ended up sticking with dad and learning to play with the Old Boys’ Club. She attended an Ivy League college, went to med school, became a surgeon and left jealous men and her resentful mother in her wake. After that, she got bored. What other mountains were there for her to climb? That’s how she got involved in demonology. Her country club had a few white-haired coots who held secret meetings in the library basement. They didn’t let her in, so she became obsessed with getting in. It took her a few months of reading quasi-occult books and studying to earn their respect. When that wasn’t enough, she eavesdropped, got them drunk and talking and went through their things until she learned enough to intimidate them. What she discovered was that these old men were keeping a demon locked up in an area hospital — had been for 20 years — and struggled to keep it under wraps. She had a new plan. Once she had gotten inside their private club-within-the-club, she read through their books on demonology and occult medicine and devised a new way not only to imprison the demon, but to channel and diminish its power. To do it, though, they’d need kidneys — human kidneys.\n\n**Description:** She has a poise that suggests she might settle into any pose for the rest of the night. When you talk, she makes eye contact with the kind of withering confidence that says, “You just don’t get it, do you?” When you’re done talking, she exhales and looks away for a second, as if she’s thinking how to boil her thoughts down into something you could understand. Her eyes are the same brown as cigarette burns. Her eyebrows are black, pruned swooshes. She barely has any lips — they’re the pink you imagine raw flesh must be, like her mouth is just a gash cut in her face so she can talk through it. Her manicured fingers remind you that she makes surgeon money\n\n**Storytelling Hints:** Catherine has seen the insides of people. She sees them all the time. She’s probably seen inside the character she’s talking to. She knows how his kidney works, both medically and mystically, and he doesn’t. People who get mad about things they don’t understand are just holding up the works. Is it even worth explaining the truth to them? Even if they believe it, will they understand?', '[]'),

(7, 10, 'Rendez-vous avec Jenny Langston, une ex connue en 2002, en couple en 2002-2003, durant ses études de droit, au Flannery\'s Bar, un de ses lieux de prédilection.  \n Devenue avocate pénale indépendante depuis, elle a défendu, avec succès, un homme qui lui a ensuite avoué être coupable. Il a été acquitté suite à la mort des témoins de l\'accusation, témoins qu\'il a tué lui-même de son propre aveu.  \n Il s\'agit de Paolo Escobar, un dealer local, crade (ordure). Arrêté pour le bracage à mains armées et le meurtre du tenancier Jimmy Jim, il y a un mois. Il laisse une fille orpheline de 16 ans.  \n Jenny est toujours aussi belle, grande blonde aux yeux noisettes. Mais elle est marquée par les révélations du meurtrier, perdue dans sa vocation à défendre les innocents.\n\nKate Rose, 36 ans, une amie de Jenny, est une \"voyante\" assez réputée en ville. Maghrébine aux cheveux roux et aux yeux verts. Plutôt petite (1m60) et fine, elle est assez jolie dans son style, avec un trèfle tatoué sur l\'avant bras.\n\nLe lendemain, Jenny est accusée du meurtre d\'Escobar, avec témoins. Kate et moi enquêtons pour prouver son innocence, puisqu\'elle a passé la soirée avec nous, et la nuit avec moi.  \n Escobar a été tué de sang froid au Alberto\'s, un bar mal famé.\n\nD\'après le témoin, Ron, le gardien du Lavomatic d\'en face, par une \"bonasse\" entrée vers 2h30, et dont la description correspond à Jenny.  \n Après avoir parlé au videur, celle-ci s\'est assise au bar, et a fumé sans arrêt pendant une demi heure. Un homme entre enfin (description d\'Escobar) et se dirige droit vers elle.  \n Il lui adresse quelques mots (\"Ouais, tu t\'es lâchée ce soir !\"), et elle le fume (sort une arme à feu et le tue de plusieurs balles).  \n Elle sort ensuite en courant par l\'arrière du bar.  \n Interrogé par Kate, il reconnait avoir pris des photos de la bonasse en question, qui s\'avère bien être Jenny.\n\nJohn Cooper, avocat de Jenny.\n\nJenny aurait été vue montant dans un taxi Mercury.  \n En interrogeant la centrale de la marque, le conducteur était Jovan Brozovich, n° 436, qui sera rentré dans l\'heure.  \n Celui-ci confirme avoir pris une femme ressemblant à Jenny, et l\'avoir amenée devant chez elle (l\'adresse est bonne).  \n Mais il affirme qu\'elle a \"disparu\" dans son taxi, n\'étant jamais descendue. Il restait juste sur la banquette arrière un tube de rouge à lèvres et une cigarette.\n\n\\- Croisement du taxi =&gt; quartier résidentiel  \n\\- Kate au bar qui torche 2/3 gars  \n\\- Kate au flic qui torche 2/3 flics  \n\\- Avocat connait le nom duflic qui interroge Jenny =&gt; Inspecteur McJay  \n\\- Kate déguisée en tueuse entre dans le bar\n\nPlaque des connards du bar (donnée aux flics)  \n Contact Kate Rose sur Döpplegangers, barjot frappadingue pervers, Miss Tic Flectcher\n\nDöppleganger !!!  \n Réglé en confessant Jenny et lui faisant prendre conscience qu\'elle n\'a pas de raison de culpabiliser...', '2006-02-16 00:00:00', 3, 'Döppel-Gangeuse', 3),

(1, 'Daeva', 'The Daeva are emotional, sensual and desirable. Sexual predators and sensual hedonists alike populate the ranks of these succubi-seducers.\r\n\r\nAmong Kindred historians, the Daeva are suspected of being one of the oldest clans of the Damned. Their moniker suggests a Persian mythological origin, and their abilities suggest that they could be related to the demons from which they take their name. A few ancient writings suggest that the progenitor of the line was a Kindred known as Aesma Daeva, but vampiric scholars debate whether this individual was actually undead or the writings merely draw comparisons to the Persian demon of lust and anger.\r\n\r\nThe name “Daeva” predates the commonly accepted origin point of Kindred society, generally understood to parallel the ascension of Rome. Certainly, some incarnation of the Daeva existed before then, but whether they had their own society or were merely a rabble of lust-crazed revenants is unknown. After the rise of Rome, the Daeva had become an inextricable part of Kindred society, and vampiric history shows that they were very active in the Camarilla, the first known social contract of the undead.', '<p>Other Kindred envy their beauty and grace, their ability to incite passion in mortals, the ease with which they glide through the masses &mdash; and that envy is almost as potent a draught to the Daeva as blood itself. These Kindred are consummate predators, and they would seem to be the perfect vampires. Alas, most are too dead inside to enjoy it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Called Succubi by other clans, the Daeva are experts at making their prey come to them, practically offering themselves not merely as food but as playthings. No self-respecting Daeva resorts to attacking transients in alleyways. Rather, these are the Kindred who accompany a smitten young mortal back to her place, leaving her languid and sexually spent by morning (if she&rsquo;s fortunate) or an exsanguinated husk (if she&rsquo;s not). Seducers and sensualists, the Daeva could practically charm the unease off a Nosferatu. When the fancy strikes them, they play politics like a finely tuned instrument. Even allies and coconspirators who know they cannot trust a Succubus find themselves lulled into doing just that, caught up in the Daeva&rsquo;s personal magnetism. Daeva become Harpies more than Kindred of any other clan, and they wield that power mercilessly. A stinging rebuke from a Daeva Harpy can shred a vampire&rsquo;s reputation faster than a denunciation by the Prince himself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most Succubi are overtly sensual beings, drawn by beauty and blood in equal measure, but it&rsquo;s an artificial passion. Their ability to feel true attachment to other people atrophies over years of manipulating the love of mortals and the respect of their fellow Kindred, until the Daeva can no longer understand those emotions as anything other than tools to be exploited and motions to imitate. For all their apparent fervor, most Succubi are as dead spiritually as they are physically. They claim to understand desire, but all they truly know is need, and it is this deadening of emotions that causes so many jaded Daeva to become depraved in their efforts to feel again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daeva move through the circles of society in which their lustful natures best serve them, whether among high society or low culture. Drawn to beauty and congregations of mortals, they often frequent theaters, galleries, trendy clubs, whiskey dives, drug dens, brothels and everything in between. Personal preferences aside, the Succubi are found through all strata of society. Their seductive natures allow these vampires to find willing vessels no matter where they go, and this ability has enabled them to thrive, to become arguably one of the most numerous clans. No single social class has room for them all, so newcomers and losers of political and social games often find themselves dwelling among the poor and unwashed &mdash; or at least the middle classes, which, since their blood is as red as any other, means basically the same thing to most Succubi. Few Kindred are as desperate as a Daeva trying to claw his way into his own niche. Wise Kindred know better than to take advantage of a Daeva in such a position, for fear he&rsquo;ll one night achieve the position and privilege he seeks. The Succubi never forget a slight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nickname:</strong> Succubi (male Daeva are sometimes called Incubi, but the clan itself is referred to by the more common female sobriquet)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Covenant:</strong> The majority of these Kindred are found within the Invictus. They are well suited to the political game, and here they can surround themselves with lessers, becoming ever more jaded and inhuman as they grow older. Most Daeva are too self-centered to feel the religious calling of the Lancea Sanctum, but those few exceptions who are able to channel their sensual drive into matters of faith often obtain positions of prominence, making the clan seem more numerous in the Lancea Sanctum than it really is. Few Daeva bother with the Carthians. Why fight for an egalitarian society when the current system favors the Daeva? The Ordo Dracul covenant is home to a small number of devoted Daeva, and it would have more if the rigors of the covenant&rsquo;s policies didn&rsquo;t make being a hedonist among its ranks less than rewarding. The Circle of the Crone has few Daeva for much the same reasons as the Lancea Sanctum, and those who do join often do so more out of a debased and jaded sense of rebellion against societal mores than any real belief in the Pagans&rsquo; teachings. A surprising number of Succubi fall in among the unaligned, convinced, in their own self-perceived superiority, that they have no need for the laws and restrictions of society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Daeva often Embrace out of infatuation &mdash; or at least going through the motions of passion &mdash; and they rarely choose to involve themselves with unattractive mortals. Thus, most Daeva are surpassingly beautiful. The clan is also highly in tune with trends and fashion, the better to prowl among and attract prey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Havens:</strong> Daeva havens vary, but they&rsquo;re almost universally comforting... in a subtly alarming way that suggests an artificial appeal to whatever vessels a Kindred favors. Most are convenient to social or political centers. The specific aesthetics vary, but most are intended to impress any compatriots, allies or victims who might be invited in. Penthouses and condominiums are particularly popular. Many Daeva don&rsquo;t bother to keep up appearances if they don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll bring prey home, meaning that some havens are sloppy or cluttered with unsettling reminders of previous vessels&rsquo; presence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Background:</strong> With a growing number of exceptions, Daeva are Embraced from the ranks of society&rsquo;s elite. Succubus sires look for some combination of charm, culture, seductiveness, desire to achieve, passion and physical beauty. Many Daeva Embrace mortals to whom they have become attached, but this attachment almost invariably proves false, a mixture of lust and simple hunger. Few relationships are as euphoric as those between a Daeva and a newly Embraced childe, and few grow cold as swiftly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Character Creation:</strong> Social Attributes and Skills are of primary concern, particularly those that aid in making good first impressions, in persuading and in seducing. Social Merits are equally common, representing the character&rsquo;s connections to both mortal and Kindred society. Given that most Daeva feed almost exclusively through manipulation and betrayal, a high starting Humanity score is a good idea, since it&rsquo;s likely to fall precipitously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Favored Attributes:</strong> Dexterity or Manipulation</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Clan Disciplines:</strong> Celerity, Majesty, Vigor</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Weakness:</strong> Perhaps out of some deep longing for the true passions they lost after the Embrace, the Daeva have difficulty steeling themselves against the hedonism they allow themselves as members of the Damned. Any time a Daeva has an opportunity to indulge her Vice but does not do so, she loses two points of Willpower (as opposed to gaining one by partaking in its pleasures).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Organization:</strong> Status among the Daeva is entirely a social issue, and many young ones resemble squabbling cliques more so than undying creatures of the night. Not even elder Daeva are strangers to petty vendettas and long-nursed grudges. While a Succubus is likely to join with one of her own in the face of an outside threat, they compete with one another as much as they do with other Kindred, if not more so. The Daeva therefore have no true formal structure. Those who are dominant in the Danse Macabre&rsquo;s social and political scene are dominant among the clan as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bloodlines:</strong> Duchagne (an aristocratic but degenerate European bloodline that seems to have the ability to directly manipulate the senses and sensations of others), Toreador (a branch of the clan that has recognized its loss of passion and tries to re-create it by inspiring mortals either to creative pursuits or extreme emotions; they invariably grow bored and move on, leaving their former wards desolate), Xiao.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Concepts:</strong> Bored socialite, club hopper, club owner, cult leader, cultured serial killer, full-time Harpy, jaded vampire who gets off on being a creature of the night (a fairly melodramatic attitude found only among the very young before the weight of the Requiem fully settles on them), Kindred politico, local covenant spokesman, patron of the arts, professional &ldquo;escort&rdquo;</p>', 'Emotional, sensual and desirable.', 2, 104, NULL, NULL, 'LogoDaeva-63869c45d79c0.webp'),
(2, 'Gangrel', 'The Gangrel are primal, hardy and savage. They embody the myths of vampires turning into animals or otherwise changing form (wolves, bats, mist).\r\n\r\nMany Kindred believe that the Gangrel clan is an old one, but due to the Gangrel’s bestial nature, few records exist that can connect their origins to any specific time period. While the murky pre-history of the Kindred contains any number of legends about bestial vampires, not all of these tales coincide with the hallmarks of the Gangrel.\r\n\r\nGeographically, the Gangrel seem to hail from what is tonight Eastern Europe, where they came in contact with the nascent Camarilla and were reluctantly drawn into that society. As Rome’s holdings moved westward, so, too did the Camarilla and thus the Gangrel. Historians also theorize strong Gangrel roots in what is modern Scandinavia. Since those early nights of society, the Gangrel have chosen the outlying borders of domains for their own territories. As such, Gangrel are often seen as pioneers, eking out an existence where domains will later form, or as scavengers, clinging desperately to territories and refusing to yield once domains have fallen.', 'While vampires give mortals a reason to be afraid of the dark, there exist things that give even vampires reason to fear — creatures like the Gangrel, the predators among the predators, the most savage of beasts. Perhaps the only clan whose mere mention almost always elicits a chilled shud- der or a reverent nod, the Gangrel are, in many ways, the “noble savages” of the vampiric race. Upon their Embrace (and sometimes before), the Gangrel seek to sever their ties with everything pertaining to their mortal lives. Many prefer the counsel of animals and other beasts, and some eschew contact with the mortal world entirely. While many retain and even value their humanity, they do so within the bounds and context of their newfound existence, and not as an attempt to hold onto what’s been lost, for no other option is practical to a clan whose very soul is so intimately intertwined with its Beast. While others delude themselves about what the Embrace “truly means,” the Gangrel know what they’ve become, so they strive to make peace with it. On the whole, they spend more time in communion with their bestial side than other vampires do, and though such activity more than accounts for their nickname and reputation, few would disagree that the Gangrel truly benefit from their introspection.\n\nTheir special bond with the Beast seems to give many Gangrel a unique insight into the Kindred condition, and some of the wisest vampires to be found in all the world hail from this clan. Whereas other Kindred try to become scholars or philosophers, collecting endless data and positing on the theoretical, the Gangrel are its yogis and medicine men, its bodhisattvas and whirling dervishes. The unequivocal and irreplaceable benefit of first-hand experience flows through them, supplanting the theoretical with the practical, and making the Gangrel widely respected among those who recognize the primeval nature of the Kindred soul. This insight makes the clan invaluable, but also makes it dangerous, and some would just as soon silence the Gangrel as hear their frank wisdom.\n\n**Nickname:** Savages\n\n  \n **Covenant:** Many Gangrel are largely unconcerned with matters of Kindred politics, but that’s not to say they don’t have their own views. Perhaps surprisingly, a significant percentage of the clan is active in the Circle of the Crone, which provides spiritually minded Gangrel with a ready-made forum for their rituals and beliefs, and a great many of the Circle’s leaders hail from the clan’s ranks. Some of the more proactive Gangrel find the Carthian mindset appealing, and a number of highly motivated Savages have taken up the cause in recent years. A few Gangrel fall in with the Lancea Sanctum and Invictus, due to the nature of each covenant’s beliefs. Those who are active in the latter group usually work for important elders or are elders themselves, while the few Gangrel of the Lancea Sanctum are among the most frightening and relentless Kindred anyone would ever (not) want to meet. Likewise, the Ordo Dracul sees few Gangrel, though some who join do so not to learn the blood magic of the covenant but to pursue mysteries of their origin without the hauteur of the Lancea Sanctum. A great many Gangrel also find their place among the independent and un- aligned Kindred, whose lack of structure and love of freedom are attractive to Savages who prefer that elders of other clans keep their politics to themselves.\n\n**Appearance:** The archetypal Savage is rarely concerned with his appearance, though most recognize the need to both blend in and put potential prey at ease. As a rule, Gangrel prefer func- tion over form, and are rarely caught clad in anything that restricts movement to any great degree. Due to their clan weak- ness, they must always be wary of just how bestial they appear to others, and some especially old (or angry) Gangrel typically learn some amount of Obfuscate to avoid potentially disastrous situations.\n\n**Havens:** One of the clan’s greatest strengths is its deft maneuverability, a good portion of which stems from its Discipline of Protean, which allows the Gangrel to take rest in any natural soil. Sleeping in the ground does, of course, have its drawbacks, and even the most feral of Savages comes to appreciate having an actual place to hang his hat after a while. A number of the more urbane (or at least urban) Gangrel therefore elect to take traditional havens, though their restless spirits and mistrust of other Kindred tends to keep them moving.\n\n**Background:** Potential Gangrel can come from nearly any former life, but few Savages would choose a mortal who did not possess a strong survival instinct. Beyond this, most are quite particular about those they sire. Gangrel loathe personal weakness and those who are soft of body or mind (especially given their weakness), particularly those with a paper-thin or disconnected sense of being. Clan members most admire those whose greatest strengths are the strengths of the self — self-awareness, self-confidence and self-reliance. While it is not unheard of for a Gangrel to Embrace someone who lacks these qualities (usually as a cruel test to see whether the Embrace will sufficiently toughen the person up), most Gangrel hold to their standards, as not doing so is often more effort than it’s worth.\n\n**Character Creation:** Gangrel are very honest with themselves about what is and is not their forte, and they seek to improve those things to which they are especially or innately suited. Many Gangrel come off seeming hyper-specialized, their players having devoted significant dots to those Attributes and Skills in which they are focused. This rule is a very general one, however, and numerous exceptions apply. Due to temperament, the aptly named Savages are rarely very strong in the Social department (though entire bloodlines of sociable Gangrel probably exist somewhere), preferring instead to hone body and reinforce the mind. An even mix of Physical and Mental Skills is always good, erring toward the Physical side.\n\n**Favored Attributes:** Composure or Stamina\n\n**Clan Disciplines:** Animalism, Protean, Resilience\n\n**Weakness:** As befits their sobriquet, the Gangrel are more closely tied to their Beasts than are other Kindred. The more they feel the call of the Beast, the more bestial they become, and the more their minds become those of less principled animals. With regard to dice pools based on Intelligence and Wits Attributes, the 10-again rule does not apply. Additionally, any 1’s that come up on a roll subtract from successes. (The latter part of the weakness does not affect dramatic-failure rules.) This weakness does not apply to dice pools involving perception or reaction to surprise (see p. 151 of the World of Darkness Rulebook), or to the Resolve Attribute.\n\n**Example:** The Gangrel Unholy is chasing Loki, who manages to elude her, but not before he drops a mystic artifact he stole from one of her other old enemies in the Ordo Dracul. The Unholy has a chance to figure out what the artifact is, her player rolling a dice pool of Intelligence + Occult (seven dice). The dice come up 10, 8, 7, 7, 6, 3 and 1. Normally, the player would roll the 10 again, but not in this case, as this dice pool involves the Unholy’s Intelligence Attribute. Furthermore, the 1 rolled cancels out one of the player’s two successes, leaving only one. The Unholy knows that this is an item of mystic significance, but she has no inkling as to what it does or what might activate it.\n\n**Organization:** The Gangrel are perhaps the least organized of the clans. They have no hierarchy per se and are largely disinterested in either clan structure or intra-clan activity for its own sake. The only nod they give to such matters comes in the form of an event called a Gather. These meetings serve a twofold purpose. First, as an opportunity for Gangrel to unite and update one another on the events of the intervening time. Second, as a forum for official intra-clan dispute resolution. Before this practice began, ferocious Savages visited their rage upon one another at will and without process, and the clan as a whole suffered. Thus began the practice of settling disputes at gatherings of the clan before a Priscus or Primogen, where any conflict (or combat, if necessary) could be moderated and monitored by the peers of both Savages. As a result of this practice, the clan has grown more cooperative over time, leading to markedly fewer  \n intra-clan kills. The majority of such disputes now stop short of Final Death.\n\n**Bloodlines:** Anavashra (mysterious ritualists who claim domains in India and Bangladesh); Anubi (Egyptian cultists who have feuded long with the Lancea Sanctum); Bruja (a rogue biker gang that slakes its thirsts at will and terrorizes Baja Mexico and Southern California); Matasuntha (a bloodline of warriors descended from an ancient warlord of the Huns); Taifa (sociable and sophisticated, these Middle Eastern Gangrel are known for their political savvy and social aptitude).\n\n**Concepts:** Archeologist, bodyguard, bumpkin, circuit rider, guru, mercenary, nomad, shaman, survivalist, urban predator, zookeeper', 'Primal, hardy and savage.', 2, 106, NULL, NULL, 'LogoGangrel-63869c4e7b4e2.webp'),
(3, 'Mekhet', 'The Mekhet are quick, discreet and wise. Legends of vampires hiding in shadows, preying secretly on victims, and even learning secrets no one else but the keeper is supposed to know probably refer to Mekhet activities.\r\n\r\nSome of the oldest Kindred known to the vampiric world are members of Clan Mekhet, though most spend their time harrowed by the cold sleep known as torpor. While most are predisposed toward solitude, some have traveled with mortal armies and are even suspected of forming undead mercenary factions of their own. As with most other clans, nothing verifiable is known about the progenitor of the Mekhet line. Many stories depict reclusive Mekhet cult-leaders or masters of schools of stealthy soldiers, so the clan might have origins that abut the Pharaohs or philosopher-kings of the Classical or Ancient worlds.\r\n\r\nThe name Mekhet itself gives some clues as to the clan’s origin, as it is an Egyptian word for “amulet.” Some of the most venerable elders certainly bear features that might be described as Egyptian, while a few have classical Hellenic complexions, which isn’t surprising, considering Greece’s proximity to Egypt. The commerce between the Egyptians and Greeks, and later the Romans, corresponds with the legendary travels of members of this clan, as well as their formative role in the nascent Camarilla. Since that time, the Mekhet have traveled wherever shadows have fallen, wherever secrets lay hidden, and wherever Kindred call upon others to give them counsel.', 'Vampires have always been creatures of the night by design, but none more so than the dwellers in darkness who compose Clan Mekhet. Darkness is the hallmark of this lineage, and its members surround themselves with it like a corpse wears a shroud. The hallmarks of the clan are stealth and wisdom, so it is entirely fitting that they are associated with darkness — the better to hide them and the source of the knowledge they exhume.\n\nClan Mekhet comprises one of the most cosmopolitan memberships among the great families of the Kindred. Although they compose a clan born of darkness, these Shadows, as they are known, interpret that darkness in many ways. Some of the clan’s members are masters of the night, using their gifts and undead powers to make a place for themselves within the aristocracy of the Damned. Others are literal skulkers in the shadows, ready to plant a stake in a rival’s heart or steal the wealth from a rival’s haven. Still others are poets or painters, heirs to darkness of a more personal nature. Yet more Mekhet are diviners of secrets, questing after information itself forgotten and thus relegated to the darkness of memory. Clan Mekhet runs the gamut from filth-streaked murderers to enlightened philosopher-Princes and everything in between.\n\nWhile the clan certainly has coarse members, the Mekhet are, by and large, marked by a certain degree of finesse with whatever aspect of tenebrous unlife they choose to pursue. A Mekhet bodyguard, for example, is unlikely to be a brawling brute, but more likely to know an ornate fighting style. A Mekhet infiltrator is gracious or invisible, not a sloppy vandal. A sage or scholar might have such supernatural acumen that his abilities are downright oracular instead of merely archival. Mekhet Kindred very much consider themselves paragons of the vampiric state, so whatever they do, they devote themselves to it and refine their capacity almost to the point of second nature.\n\n**Nickname:** Shadows\n\n**Covenant:** A great many Mekhet fall in with the Carthians or the Lancea Sanctum, both of which have strong traditions of politics and secrecy to which the Shadows can lend their talents. The same can be said of the Circle of the Crone, which typically draws Mekhet by virtue of its underlying message of redemption and meaning in the unlives of the Damned. Less philosophical and more viscerally impassioned Shadows are often drawn to the ranks of the unaligned, whose ideology of freedom (or anonymity...) is an easy fit for the wild at heart. This is not to say that the clan is weak within the Invictus, though. Invictus Shadows are simply quieter about their covenant affiliation than their boastful brothers, or are at least more reserved about the reasons for their affiliation, which typically coincide with those of the Carthians or Lancea Sanctum. More than a few Mekhet find themselves among the Ordo Dracul, as the study of its esoteric principles often coincides with artifact-finding expeditions or secrets to be gleaned from other Dragons.\n\n**Appearance:** Of all the clans, the Mekhet are perhaps the least uniform in the way they appear to others. Some play the clan archetype to the hilt, dressing in black clothing and adopting styles that allow them to blend into the scenery. Others choose from popular mortal styles and fashions, attempting to blend in with the crowd by evading individual notice. This practice is particularly common among Mekhet who associate with one particular subculture, thereby becoming an iconic, though rarely outstanding, example of that group’s tastes.\n\n**Havens:** Of all the clans, the Mekhet are typically the most polarized by their preferences and proximity to the mortal world. Some Mekhet prefer to keep close to where the action is. In large cities, where their numbers are strong, many take flats in the downtown core, or at least within short distance of various urban hot spots or the Rack. Older or more withdrawn Shadows are often preoccupied with security, and many elect to dwell in large homes on the outskirts of populated areas. Such Kindred often keep dogs and other servitors, made strong by the cursed Vitae of their masters. A few paranoid Shadows even take havens underground, where they cohabitate (or compete) with Nosferatu for shelter from the sun.\n\n**Background:** Prospective Mekhet can come from just about any walk of mortal life. The only common thread linking potential candidates is an affinity for the night itself or some metaphorical darkness, such as a pained soul or a thirst for knowledge. Many Mekhet are tutored heavily by their sires post-Embrace, in order that they understand the nature of the clan and its duties. A Mekhet sire who leaves a new childe to the misinformation of other Kindred is a rarity indeed. Some prefer to let their progeny discover the Kindred world on their own, but not even these sires stray so far that they can’t watch a protégés’ progress.\n\n**Character Creation:** Most Shadows prize those traits that best assist them in furthering their passion or their cause. Violent or politically motivated Mekhet typically favor Physical and Social Attributes and Skills, to improve their dealings with others and to allow them to strike from their namesake. Scholarly or philosophical clan members tend to acquire as many dots worth of Mental traits as they can. For many Shadow players, the process of assigning new traits is like being a kid in a candy store — just about everything looks good, but you don’t have a whole lot to spend. The best solution is to keep your character’s personality in mind when deciding what to take.\n\n**Favored Attributes:** Intelligence or Wits\n\n**Clan Disciplines:** Auspex, Celerity, Obfuscate\n\n**Weakness:** As creatures of darkness even more sensitive to light than most of the Damned, the Mekhet suffer certain banes of vampiric existence more acutely than do their fellow Kindred. Whenever Mekhet suffer damage from sunlight or fire, they take an additional point of aggravated damage from that source (see p. 172 for more on sunlight and fire damage). Just as shadow cannot exist without light, so too does light banish shadow.  \n **Example:** Loki catches the telltale smell of smoke and realizes that the hotel where he’s visiting the Mekhet Priscus is on fire. He dashes out the door into the burning hallway. Normally, this would cause three points of damage, but Loki’s Mekhet susceptibility to flame increases it to four. Loki sprints down the hall, hoping the whole building isn’t an inferno....\n\n**Organization:** While Mekhet is not the most tightly organized of clans, it does have some structure. The majority of it falls in line with the clan’s various bloodlines, which are generally more independent than those of other clans. Nonetheless, some clanwide structure does exist. In addition to the Primogen in any Mekhet-heavy city, the Shadows often give more deference to a Priscus in clan affairs than do members of other clans, particularly if a Priscus has earned a reputation for wisdom.\n\n**Bloodlines:** Agonistes (Mediterranean historians and philoso- phers who seek to record and retain the knowledge Kindred lose over time and in torpor); Mnemosyne (fervent vampires who pos- sess the ability to share memories and experiences through blood ties); the Morbus lineage of European origin that suffers the Requiem with tainted Vitae; Norvegi (an inbred, degenerate cult of spies and thieves); Sangiovanni (Venetian necromancers who maintain a tight family structure that Embraces exclusively from its own mortal stock).\n\n**Concepts:** Antiquities scholar, assassin, Casanova, diplomat, enforcer, fence, ghetto Harpy, pilgrim, policeman, power behind the praxis, seer', 'Quick, discreet and wise.', 2, 108, NULL, NULL, 'LogoMekhet-63869c5808610.webp'),
(4, 'Nosferatu', 'The Nosferatu are stealthy, strong and terrifying. Their very presence unnerves people, whether by physical ugliness, foul stench or nebulous personal malignance.\r\n\r\nStudies of Nosferatu legend suggest that the clan is relatively young, possibly originating not too long before the rise of Rome, and possibly among the peoples it conquered. Certainly, the Nosferatu were active among the clans of the Camarilla, but proof of their presence before then is spotty at best. And yet, claims occasionally surface about very old Kindred who, if not Nosferatu, are strikingly *like* the Nosferatu. Whether these vampires are indeed members of the same clan, are Kindred of some “proto-clan” that became the Nosferatu, or are entirely unrelated can only be guessed at.\r\n\r\nLegends of the *nosferatu* are historically heaviest in central Europe, particularly in Germany, northern Italy and eastern France. Early records describing what seem to be broods of Nosferatu also originate in modern Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Greece, with some indication of presence in north Africa as well. Like the Gangrel, Nosferatu tend to either seek out territories before or after most of Kindred culture bothers with them. Unlike the Gangrel, though the Nosferatu adapt relatively quickly to the presence of other vampires, relying on their monstrous nature to make a place for them in the society of the Damned.', 'Not all curses are created equal, and even the Damned have outcasts. These are the Nosferatu, the most overtly disturbing of the undead. Only sometimes able to pass as human, the Haunts are horribly warped by the Embrace, either physically or... otherwise. They dwell in shadows that other vampires would not dare. Even other undead fear the Nosferatu, for their unsettling seemings are constant reminders that those Kindred who look mortal are not. They grudgingly respect the Nosferatu as well. These blighted creatures have incredible powers of stealth, terrifying strength, and they embody the monstrous destructive force that every one of the Damned can muster if pushed too far. If they had their druthers, most other clans would prefer never to associate with the Nosferatu at all, yet the Haunts’ inarguable talents and brute force make them too dangerous to ignore. So other Kindred offer them a tense hospitality, hide their unease behind wary diplomacies and pray that the Nosferatu leave as soon as possible.\n\nMany Nosferatu conceal their loneliness and resentment behind masks of indifference. They scoff in turn at those who recoil from them, belittling pretty vampires with soirées and silly political games, all the while seething at their exclusion. This isolation has fostered strong familial bonds among the Nosferatu. To those outside their ranks, they put on a unified front, creating the impression of a single extended network. The truth, of course, is that Nosferatu squabble and compete with one another as much as members of any other clan — but when faced with an outside threat, they close ranks.\n\nThe Nosferatu’s inability to blend in with society forces them to dwell apart, often congregating in places others shun. Some find sanctuary in the sewers, using influence with mortal government and construction, as well as their own substantial strength, to expand simple maintenance tunnels and sluiceways into vast underground warrens. Others lurk in cemeteries, sharing aboveground crypts with sedentary occupants. Still others prefer abandoned homes, often giving rise to neighborhood urban legends of haunted houses, or exist in the basements or boiler rooms of modern office buildings. Tradition holds that any Nosferatu is welcome in any warren until she provides her brethren reason to expel her. The Haunts might not all get along, but they recognize their common bond — not that they have any choice, since it follows their aspect like a miasma.\n\nFeared by and therefore ostracized from society, many Nosferatu become as alien as their demeanor. Others choose the opposite path, becoming surprisingly cultured, well mannered and well spoken to compensate for their unnerving seeming. The latter are the Haunts most frequently found playing politics with other Kindred. The Nosferatu are also known as purveyors of information. Not only do their supernatural powers make them foes to be reckoned with, but many elder Nosferatu are keepers of an- cient lore, rivaling anything preserved by the Ventrue or Mekhet. Sophisticated Haunts trade knowledge the way other Kindred trade favors, and if a Nosferatu doesn’t know some- thing, he can probably scare someone who does into telling him. It is this trade in terror, more than anything else, that makes the Nosferatu too valuable — and too dangerous — to ignore. After all, one never knows what the horrid Haunts tell one’s enemies, or how many of them wait in ambush.\n\n**Nickname:** Haunts\n\n**Covenant:** The Nosferatu are everywhere. The Invictus nervously welcomes them as enforcers, informants and soldiers. Those Nosferatu who obtain power in the First Estate tend to extremes; becoming relatively benevolent rulers, remembering what it was like to be downtrodden, or attempting to make up for the anguish they suffered by heaping it upon others. Haunts who seek to understand why God has done this to them, and those penitents who feel that they must atone for whatever sins drew the curse upon them, find solace in the ranks of the Lancea Sanctum. Haunts often find a place among the Ordo Dracul, where their disturbing bearing has little immediate effect on their achievements in the covenant (and might even aid them, as it discourages casual social calls). The Carthians appeal to those who are concerned with constructing a society in which everyone, no matter how unsettling, has a voice. Those Nosferatu who truly suffer beneath the weight of their curse often find the redemptive teachings of the Circle of the Crone far too tempting to resist. Even the unbound attract those who accept their terrifying nature and who want to tear down the system that quakes at their passing — or those who just want to get away.\n\n**Appearance:** No two Nosferatu have exactly the same air, though troubling characteristics often follow patterns within “families.” Discolored leathery skin, gaping maws, rubbery skin, misshapen heads, odors like grave earth, bulging eyes, queasy stares and personal habits, gnarled hands, ineffable feelings of dread, sagging flesh — all these and more are the hallmarks of the clan. Not every Haunt is physically deformed. Indeed, many are not, instead discomfiting those who look upon them with indescribable unease. The darkness and filth in which many Nosferatu dwell make their foul miens (and fouler odors) even worse.\n\n**Havens:** Most Nosferatu dwell in places far from mortals, such as abandoned warehouses, graveyards, basements and of course the ever-popular sewers and subway tunnels. That said, some few Nosferatu choose to flout tradition and take their havens in penthouses, fantastic manors — anyplace where they can enjoy the luxuries of wealth yet still count on substantial privacy.\n\n**Background:** Nosferatu normally choose progeny from among society’s castoffs, such as the homeless, the mentally ill and criminals. Many Nosferatu Embrace out of spite, using the curse to punish vanity, cruelty or other such “sins.” Assuming a sire wants a childe to survive — which isn’t always the case — Haunts tend to choose self-reliant individuals who might actually be able to manage their new condition. Few Nosferatu Embrace out of love or affection, though even this is not unheard of. Rare but heartbreaking are the tales of a Nosferatu determined to “gift” his love with the Requiem, only to find himself the object of his beloved’s loathing when she learns what’s been done to her.\n\n**Character Creation:** Physical and Mental Attributes are more useful to most Haunts than Social. Nosferatu frequently make use of Skills such as Stealth and Survival. It’s unwise to begin with too high a Blood Potency; until a Nosferatu has obtained some experience in the Requiem, he might be forced to rely on animal blood. Although Nosferatu aren’t social creatures, certain Social Merits such as Contacts can be useful for gaining information from inaccessible areas.\n\n**Favored Attributes:** Composure or Strength\n\n**Clan Disciplines:** Nightmare, Obfuscate, Vigor\n\n**Weakness:** All Nosferatu are repulsive or at the very least uncomfortable to be around. The cause need not be a physical deformity. A palpable aura of menace, a charnel odor or the undeniable manner of a predator is just as compelling as a twisted body. With regard to dice pools based on Presence or Manipulation Attributes in social situations, the 10-again rule does not apply. Additionally, any 1’s that come up on a roll are subtracted from successes. (This latter part of the weakness does not affect dramatic failure rules.) This weakness does not apply to dice pools that involve the Intimidation Skill, or to the Composure Attribute.  \n **Example:** The Nosferatu Scratch attempts to smooth-talk his way past a ghoul standing guard at a nightclub door. Scratch has a Presence of 4 and a Persuasion of 2 — his player rolls six dice and comes up with 1, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 10. The net result is two successes: The 1 cancels the 8, the 9 counts as normal, and the 10 isn’t rolled again. Organization: The Nosferatu have little formal organization, but as stated previously they do tend to band together in the face of outside threats. The clan is almost tribal, with differing “families” of Nosferatu often sticking together or warring against one another. Clan hierarchy, such as it is, is usually determined by a combination of seniority and actual merit.\n\n**Bloodlines:** Acteius; Baddacelli; Noctuku (violent cannibals who dwell near rural areas and who prefer to feed on other Kindred); Yagnatia (a Russian family that claims unbroken lineage from both ancient nobility and witches); Burakumin (an Asian lineage that might possess necromantic powers, but information on Asian vampires is regrettably scarce even by Kindred standards).\n\n**Concepts:** Bogeyman, circus freak, crude sadist, guardian angel, leg-breaker, parvenu, petty thief, rat king, reclusive eccentric, snitch, sycophantic servant', 'Stealthy, strong and terrifying.', 2, 110, NULL, NULL, 'LogoNosferatu-63869c5dcac78.webp'),
(5, 'Ventrue', 'The Ventrue are regal, commanding and aristocratic. Vampires as everything from Eastern European lords on the mountain to gentrified nobles to modern corporate raiders belong to this clan.\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, the Ventrue are understood to be the youngest of the clans, almost certainly originating in Rome itself, probably in tandem with the formation of the Camarilla. While their history is relatively short (in vampiric terms), it is also distinguished, as the Ventrue are made to rule. Although none remember the name of the first Ventrue, various vampiric histories do ascribe the origin of the clan, which was believed to once be a covenant, to a single female vampire. A darker history implies that this Kindred was not the first of the Ventrue line, but that she consumed the soul of her own sire, and in so doing founded a new bloodline that rose to the status of a proper clan.\r\n\r\nAs might be surmised, the Ventrue have historically been strongest in Europe, from which they grew into North and Central America, but their presence elsewhere in the world has been relatively minor. As a clan, their numbers are probably fewer than those of any other clan, but such things vary by domain, as one vampire community might consist of nothing but Ventrue — likely all the preeminent Kindred’s progeny.', 'The Ventrue offer a very simple boast: They win. They always win.\n\nOther Kindred often despise the Lords, but they seldom dispute the clan’s boast. All too often, a Kindred works and schemes to win some prize, only to find that a Ventrue owned it all along. The officers who lead a city’s Kindred almost always include several highly placed Ventrue. The Lords acknowledge no defeats, only setbacks. The clan shares a ruthless will to power and the power to enforce its will.\n\nTheir favored Disciplines account for some of their success. The Ventrue learn to command the thoughts of other beings almost by instinct. Their mastery of lesser animals harks back to nights of domains in which the Lord was a master of beasts as well as men. Although they do not especially cultivate the arts of combat, they often prove remarkably hard to kill. Ventrue regard their supernatural gifts, however, as merely a tool to begin the acquisition of real power — the power of money, property, corporate stock, political contacts, rank in Kindred society and large numbers of mortals, at every level of society, begging to lick their boots and fulfill their commands.\n\nThe Ventrue take the feudal nature of Kindred society very seriously. Every sire tells her childe that some people rule, and some are ruled. As Lords, they should strive to place themselves among the rulers. Most Ventrue neonates already believed this before their Embrace. Throughout the clan’s his- tory, the Ventrue have sought power in whatever forms mortals offered. Kindred historians say that in ancient Rome the clan Embraced senators and patricians. In the Middle Ages, they brought knights and churchmen into the fold. As commerce became an avenue to power, they cultivated merchant princes, bankers and magnates. When states grew more bureaucratic, the Lords Embraced high-ranking civil servants. The rise of organized crime brought mob bosses and drug kingpins into the clan. At the start of the 21st century, Ventrue elders ponder the merits of Embracing scientists, engineers and computer wizards. No matter where in society the power lies, the Ventrue vow to exploit it before other Kindred even know it exists.\n\n**Nickname:** Lords\n\n**Covenant:** Many Kindred see the Ventrue as almost synonymous with the Invictus. Indeed, Ventrue tend to rise to leadership positions within that covenant. Almost as many find a place in the Ordo Dracul, acquiring immediate power of a different stripe, which the Lords ultimately turn toward the same ends. They also rise to leadership among the Sanctified, however, and some Ventrue find the power they crave within the Carthians, the Circle of the Crone or even amid the ranks of the unbound. Some Ventrue neonates hardly bother to hide their intent to use a gang of unaligned Kindred as a stepping-stone to power within another covenant.\n\n**Appearance:** Ventrue often adopt a conservative, low-key appearance that expresses high status without being flashy. Young Lords sometimes favor a “preppy” look, the timeless suit-and-tie uniform of business, or (for female Lords) elegant gowns or business skirt-suits, with unobtrusive jewelry. Ventrue elders might keep the styles of long ago, at least in their own havens, and in public they still tend to look decades out of date. Even rebellious young Ventrue wear their metal-studded jackets like a uniform, asserting their dominance. A Lord surrounds himself with other trappings of wealth and status, too, from the big, fancy car in the garage to the wine cellar full of vintages he will never again have the opportunity to enjoy.\n\n**Havens:** If a Ventrue did not possess great wealth before the Embrace, she often becomes rich afterward. Ventrue select their havens to reflect their wealth and power. Many Lords dwell in mansions or actual walled estates. Few would settle for anything less than a classic townhouse or penthouse apartment (with secure curtains, of course).  \n Clan tradition holds that any Ventrue may claim sanctuary from the sun at any other Lord’s haven and not be refused, but few Lords ever invoke this right. Not only do proud Lords hate to beg another Kindred’s aid, a supplicant henceforth owes a debt of honor to the Ventrue who provided refuge. Great shame would befall any Lord who denied a clanmate or who could not provide a comfortable rest, however, so a prudent Ventrue makes sure his haven can accommodate a Kindred guest or two.\n\n**Background:** The Ventrue most often seek childer among the ranks of professionals or the cream of high society. Some Lords prefer childer from “old money” families or political dynasties, as the closest the modern world comes to feudal nobility. Other Lords prefer self-made leaders such as millionaire entrepreneurs, politicians, military officers or even crime bosses. As new professions and new forms of power arise, the Ventrue bring them into the clan. The rise of the computer industry, for instance, has prompted a wave of tech-sector childer.\n\n**Character Creation:** Ventrue favor Social Attributes and Skills — the traits needed for leadership — though they also value Mental Attributes and Skills such as Politics and Academics. The clan excels at Social Merits such as Resources, Contacts and Status. Most Lords possessed great social influence in life, and they acquire more in undeath.\n\n**Favored Attributes:** Presence or Resolve\n\n**Clan Disciplines:** Animalism, Dominate, Resilience\n\n**Weakness:** Power corrupts, and among the Ventrue, even the thirst for power can corrode an ambitious Kindred’s moral bearings. Over time, some Ventrue grow paranoid, ever more wary of rivals’ desires (real or imagined) for their own holdings. Others become willing to do whatever it takes to acquire the smallest iota of additional power. Still others turn inward, delude themselves as to their ability and importance, or trouble their minds with other maladies. Ventrue Kindred suffer a -2 penalty to Humanity rolls to avoid acquiring derangements after a failed degeneration roll.\n\n**Organization:** The Lords track their ties of blood and obligation through an old-boy network that extends across generations, bloodlines and continents. A respectable Ventrue knows his fellow Lords’ ancestors, their broodmates, allies, enemies and Kindred owed and owing favors (though the information might be a century out of date). Two Ventrue often compare lineages and acquaintances when they first meet. Thus do they establish their relationships and status within the clan.  \n The Ventrue also take clan offices very seriously. Ventrue Whips, Prisci and other clan leaders often try to hold monthly meetings of all clanmates, regardless of covenant. The Lords use these meetings as opportunities to brag, size up the competition, cut deals and chide clanmates who seem to show insufficient ambition. After all, the Ventrue have a reputation for steel-fisted power to uphold. One does not want other Kindred thinking that any Lord might go soft.\n\n**Bloodlines:** Much of the clan consists of lineages that claim descent from famous Ventrue of the distant past, such as the great Cassius. These “bloodlines” merely express pride in ancestry: A Cassian Ventrue, for instance, does not differ greatly from other Lords. Other prestigious lineages include the Licinii, the Beni Murrahim and the Rötgrafen. The comparatively new Malkovian lineage suffers even more debilitating madness than the parent clan.\n\n**Concepts:** Corporate CEO, crooked cop, gang chief, military officer, old-time ward boss, patron of the arts, political consultant, rave promoter, realtor, society matron, technical wizard', 'Regal, commanding and aristocratic.', 2, 112, NULL, NULL, 'LogoVentrue-63869c64551f4.webp'),

(7, 'Toreador', 'Lovers and creators of art, descended from a legendary and proud Spanish nobleman.', 'To the unwashed, ignorant masses, the Daeva are sleek, haughty, alluring, idealized predators who’ve been gifted with eternal youth, beauty and undying style because they’re just that much better than regular mortals. The Kindred of the Toreador bloodline see themselves in much the same way, only they elevate themselves above the thrashing, hedonistic, uncultured Daeva as well. They’re too well mannered and aloof to say as much to the Daeva, but what they leave unsaid in mixed company could fill volumes.\n\nThe name “Toreador” reflects not only the bloodline’s noble history, but its members’ fascination with the fine arts that they hold dear even tonight. Its founder, Garcilaso de Castillejo, was the second son of a moderately influential Spanish nobleman and a peer and rival of the innovative torero (bullfighter) Francisco Romero, whose grandson Pedro carried on the tradition and is legendary even today. Castillejo might have even surpassed Romero in skill and innovation in the eternal escalafon of Spanish bullfighters had he not been seduced and Embraced by an influential Andalusian Daeva while he was still in his prime. He adapted quickly to his undead state and impressed his Kindred peers with his charm, wit and grace. He even continued to fight bulls in secluded, hidden arenas for the delighted Kindred nobility until King Philip V decried the sport as barbarous and pressured a compliant pope to threaten willful noble toreros with excommunication. Fickle Spanish Sanctified chose to enforce Philip’s will among their own kind, denouncing the entire spectacle as a sacrilegious mockery of Abel’s sacrifice, largely at the urging of a Daeva Bishop in Seville who was jealous of Castillejo’s growing fame.\n\nYet Castillejo disregarded this slight with his characteristic aplomb and looked for other ways to fill his time at ease. He became a patron of the arts and a nigh-obsessive student of them, arranging travel into Italy, France, Greece, Portugal and even England to track down artists or to follow exciting new movements that caught his fancy. His adventurous spirit and unshakable will attracted cultured, indolent Daeva from all over Europe to his side, and they emulated every opinion and behavior of their charismatic torero in attempts to curry his favor. In time, amused outsiders came to refer to not only Castillejo but his growing cult of personality as El Toreros. When Castillejo finally chose to Embrace childer and those progeny demonstrated an aptitude for Dominate —which iron-willed Castillejo had learned from a Ventrue patron and lover in Venice — the nickname was applied to them as well.\n\nWhen the bloodline gained recognition among European Kindred societies, it was known as the Torero line, and it remained thus for almost a century. Then, in the last quarter of the 19th century, Castillejo’s favorite childe, Cristóbal de la Vega saw the opening-night performance of Bizet’s opera Carmen. He was so profoundly moved by the performance of Jacques Bouhy as the bullfighter Escamillo that he convinced Castillejo to come see the performance with him the next night. When he did, Castillejo was so pleased by Bouhy’s performance that he insisted upon the adoption of the inexpertly translated word “Toreador” in place of Torero in reference to his bloodline. Ever eager to please their founder and paragon, vampires of the line and associated Daeva hangers-on eagerly followed suit.\n\nIn the century-and-a-quarter since then, however, Castillejo has grown jaded and bored by the evolution of what passes for fine art. He has withdrawn into seclusion somewhere in the mountains of Andalusia to pray that the inspired artists of the Age of Enlightenment will be reborn soon so he’ll have a reason to travel the world again as he did as a young Kindred. Yet his haughty sycophants can be found all over the world, insinuating themselves among the mortal elite in cultural centers of high art (such as New York, Paris, Milan and Madrid). Many of them spend their nights seeking inspired, classically trained artists and attempting to groom them into talented Kindred prodigies whose works will shake Castillejo out of his ennui. Others slavishly try to hone their own talents to perfection in hopes of doing the same thing. Some have even realized they don’t need Castillejo’s constant attention and approval to enjoy the status and influence they’ve garnered as Toreador. Possessed of their inceptor’s will, determination and grace, they’ve set their sights on supplanting the disconsolate old Kindred in the affections of their adoring brothers and sisters.\n\n**Parent Clan:** Daeva\n\n**Nickname:** Patrons\n\nCovenant: The Toreador believe any covenant would be lucky to have them, but not every covenant is worthy of them. Nonetheless, no self-respecting Toreador is so gauche as to go slumming among the unaligned. (*Honestly*....) The closest many Toreador come to thumbing their noses at established authority and going their own way is joining the Carthians, though they usually do so only to spite a rival in an opposing covenant or because the Carthians have the most sway in the Toreador’s chosen domain. Members of the bloodline traditionally shy away from joining the Circle of the Crone because of a story their elders hand down about a member of that covenant whom their founder held in particular contempt and openly derided at court. Likewise, they both fear and respect devout members of the Lancea Sanctum, though they are wary of the intentions of certain hypocritical or overzealous Sanctified. And yet, piety and passion have inspired some of the most profoundly moving works of art in history, so finding the odd Toreador among the Lancea Sanctum is not unheard of. Many Toreador can be found among the Ordo Dracul, although many members of the Order consider the Toreador effete dilettantes who don’t have the capacity to master the Coils of the Dragon (which is not generally an inaccurate estimation). The covenant that attracts most Toreador is the Invictus. Not only is the Invictus accepting of them, but it aspires to the ideal of the undying feudal elite, of which the Toreador naturally account themselves.\n\n**Appearance:** The eldest and most influential Toreador come from Spanish or Italian stock (including Sardinia and Corsica). They show the same range of appearance as south European mortals, from the duskiness of a part-Moorish Andalusian to the blonde hair of a part-Nordic Lombard. Young Patrons display a wider variety of ethnicity, but all of them represent the ideals of classical or exotic beauty to which men and women of the era in which they were Embraced aspired. In public and among their few accepted peers, they dress as paragons of the styles most popular at the time. In private, many Toreador cling to the bygone high-style fashions of their breathing days.\n\n**Haven:** Toreador havens come in two varieties: the disarrayed studio of the self-absorbed artist, or the lavishly appointed haven of the elite socialite patron. The latter is far more common, and all such spaces have at least a couple of objets d’art on display. Most Toreador consider it gauche to display their own artwork (or not to display that of their guests) when entertaining fellow Kindred.\n\n**Background:** The Toreador aren’t quite — quite — as picky about selecting physically beautiful people for the Embrace as the Daeva are. Charm, wit and grace are far more important than simplistic concerns about symmetry or bone structure. They also look for artistic talent that inspires them or at least a consummate love and learned understanding of the fine arts. The Toreador are just as prone to Embrace out of guilt or passion as the Daeva, but they don’t make a habit of welcoming those illegitimate childer into the bloodline afterward.\n\nAs for adopting other Daeva into their august ranks, it simply isn’t done. It takes at least two Toreador in good standing to propose and second a novillo (a neonate Daeva of Toreador lineage) for inclusion within the bloodline, and a Toreador elder (known as a diestro) must give his blessing in a ceremony called the alternativa. If the novillo doesn’t have a traceable pedigree of respected Toreador ancestors leading directly back to the founder, it would take a miracle for him to get a Toreador to even acknowledge him, much less support his dreams of adoption.\n\n**Character Creation:** The Toreador rely primarily on Social Attributes across the board, although few can be accused of lacking in Wits or Resolve. Intelligence and the Physical Attributes are not quite as important to them as making a powerful and lasting first impression, but few Kindred can honestly claim to have met an especially weak, stupid or clumsy Toreador. Social Skills are often primary, with a notable preference for Expression, Socialize and a haughty, unspoken style of Intimidation. Social Merits predominate, as do ones such as Status, Haven and Herd — all of which reflect the decadent opulence with which the Toreador surround themselves and the allure such trappings have for mortal victims. It also makes sense to buy a second dot of Blood Potency unless you intend to play the character as a novillo Daeva struggling for acceptance among his Toreador betters.\n\n**Bloodline Disciplines:** Celerity, Dominate, Majesty, Vigor\n\n**Weakness:** Like the Daeva, every Toreador finds it difficult to resist his hedonistic impulses. When he opts not to indulge his Vice, a Toreador Kindred loses two Willpower points. In addition, all members of the Toreador bloodline share their inceptor’s peculiar obsession with fine art. Whether this obsession is imposed culturally or inherited mystically is unknown, but most Toreador hardly recognize it as a weakness at all. When a Toreador is exposed to a work of art in a particular style (chosen at character creation), he becomes intensely fascinated with it and is unable to divert his attention. (General examples include sculpture, painting, music, drama, dance, jewelry and fashion. Most Toreador also focus on the work of specific artists, styles or movements that were popular among the cultural elite when they were Embraced.) The player must spend a Willpower point or succeed at a reflexive Resolve roll to break the spell, or the Toreador does nothing but focus on the object of fascination for the rest of the scene, or until said object is taken away. The character also regains control if he is attacked or otherwise physically broken from his reverie.\n\nThe nature of this obsession need not necessarily be rapt appreciation. While the average Toreador is entranced by beauty, some focus all of their scornful energy on the work of a particular artist, period or movement that they despise, criticizing it vehemently and mercilessly for as long as others are willing to listen.\n\n**Organization:** Since the Toreador don’t strive as a unified front to achieve a specific goal, they don’t tend to hew to a strict hierarchy. A handful might gather in an informal group called a salon, a peña or simply a clique until jealousy or petty disagreements drive them apart. These groups most often form around particularly charismatic diestros, and the internal pecking order is determined by each member’s status. These groups sometimes include fascinating or promising novillo Daeva, but only in the minority. The fickle, flighty nature of the Toreador doesn’t lend itself to long-term compatriot loyalty, so the thing that best holds a Toreador group together is an enemy or victim in common.\n\n**Concepts:** Bullfighter, buyer for a museum, character assassin, gallery owner, Harpy, Master of Elysium, promising young artist, reclusive retired maestro, sycophantic courtier, vicious critic', 'Patrons', 2, 246, 1, NULL, 'DaevaToreador-6386c308ee51d.webp'),
(8, 'Bruja', 'Bikers, gangers, and other thuggish and impulsive troublemakers', 'The bloodline known as the Filhos des Bruja (or Bruja’s Sons, or simply the Bruja) seems like something out a nightmare or drug trip from the ’60s. It’s a motorcycle gang of vampires, ghouls and a few handfuls of blood dolls — all dirty, mean-as-hell, leather-wearing monsters tearing up the American Southwest on roaring black American motorcycles when the sun goes down. It might almost be funny to those who’ve never seen the Bruja in action, but this isn’t some bullshit Sunday-afternoon club for impotent middle-aged men, or another overcommercialized Big Red Machine. These guys are locusts who hate you and who have no respect for notions of domain or the Kindred Traditions.\n\nThe gang first formed in the late ’40s around a charismatic punk bastard named Carlos Saavedra. Growing up a lazy, no-account orphan during the Depression, Saavedra kept himself amused with petty crime, animal cruelty and a burgeoning love of violence. Yet, no matter how many of his friends got roughed up or hauled down to juvenile detention for going along with his illicit whims, Carlos was never caught, arrested or even so much as charged for anything he did wrong. His uncanny luck earned him the nickname Hijo de Bruja (“witch’s boy”), which later became just Bruja. His knack for staying out of trouble couldn’t last forever, though, and shortly after he was drafted into the army to fight in the war, he was drummed right back out for drunkenness and incompetence. He was sent back home in disgrace, where he fell in with the Booze Fighters motorcycle gang.\n\nIt was some years later when Carlos caught the attention of an iconoclastic Gangrel who became obsessed with transforming Carlos “Bruja” Saavedra into a compliant but violent weapon who could threaten the established Prince in the Gangrel’s home domain. He Embraced Carlos and tried to urge him toward the Carthian cause, only to learn that his childe would have none of it. Bruja saw his cursed condition as a newfound power, and immediately went back to his gang to “gift” his six closest friends and accomplices with more of that same power. The seven of them then broke off from the Booze Fighters to form their own gang, the Filhos des Bruja. When Carlos’ sire tracked his errant progeny down and tried to correct his mistake, the entire gang jumped him and Carlos diablerized him on the spot.\n\nSince then, the gang’s been growing slowly and getting worse. Where it once comprised just seven troublemakers whose nastiest crimes included vandalism, assault and disturbing the peace, it’s now become a fairly widespread criminal organization. It makes money in drug-trafficking, prostitution, illegal arms dealing, extortion, smuggling, murder for hire and transporting illegal immigrants across the border, just to give a handful of examples. These activities draw customers and potential victims to them, but they also risk drawing Masquerade-shattering attention from local and federal authorities.\n\nWhat’s worse, Bruja himself has disappeared in the last five years, which hasn’t helped to calm the gang down one bit. Before he left, Carlos demanded at least a modicum of restraint when the gang pulled in somewhere to feed — he even advocated keeping the gang’s Blood Potencies low in order to maintain the option of feeding on animal blood to take the edge off the Hunger. Without him, though, that restraint is dust in the wind, and it’s only a matter of time before the Bruja start descending on isolated Southwestern towns like modern-day Vikings, murdering everyone in sight and razing everything to the ground. It’s possible that a more mature Carlos Saavedra saw this potential arising in the gang and rode away from it all in disgust, but it’s just as likely that one or two of his treacherous cronies took that option out of his hands.\n\nRegardless, the bloodline remains, and even the youngest, meanest, most ignorant members proudly uphold the values of greed, willfulness and sloth that Carlos espoused before he disappeared. In his name, they do what they can to make his gang a symbol of fearsome power and hell-bound eternal freedom.\n\n**Parent Clan:** Gangrel\n\n**Nickname:** Rabble\n\n**Covenant:** This bloodline is really too small and too young to include members representing all the covenants. In fact, most members’ only loyalty (half-hearted and cloudy though it might be) is to the gang and to the ideals of the founder. While that technically makes the entire bloodline unaligned — or unbound, which is the term Bruja preferred — the odd member drifts away and winds up with one of the established covenants. Some members of the gang have gotten it into their heads somehow that Bruja hooked up with the Ordo Dracul and won’t come back until he’s become something else altogether. Their conviction inspires some jaded or gullible deserters to follow in his supposed footsteps. Others try to hook up with the Circle of the Crone, convinced that Bruja’s nickname means something, man. More rational Bruja make contacts with the Carthians when members of that covenant work hard to unseat power players and are willing to turn a blind eye to what the gang is up to in exchange for help. Sometimes said Carthians’ passion turns into revolutionary fervor, and a particularly charismatic movement-leader can lure away young, excitable Bruja. No Bruja has ever hooked up with the Invictus or the Lancea Sanctum, though, except as a result of brainwashing, blackmail or forced conversion and acceptance of the sacraments. For the most part, the Bruja try to stay the hell away from those two covenants, lest powerful elders of either (or both) crack down on the gang’s whole operation. Not even Bruja himself pushed his infamous luck that much.\n\n**Appearance:** Most Bruja are black, white, Hispanic or of mixed heritage, anywhere on the spectrum among those three. They’re generally big, loud, hairy, tattooed, unkempt, bristling with body piercings and covered in road dirt (if not blood from a sloppy feeding). The way they dress comes across as an homage to every outlaw biker movie that’s ever been made since the ’50s. They wear heavy leather or denim jackets, hobnail boots, metal helmets (if any), torn-up jeans and T-shirts, with “accessories” like aviator goggles, studded fingerless leather gloves, chain epaulets and bandanas to ward off flying dust. None of them wears any insignia to indicate what gang they belong to, but the bloodline is still small enough that most Kindred members recognize each other on sight. No self-respecting Bruja would ride anything but a burly, growling American bike — no rice rockets — or keep it in anything less than prime running condition. They might be rabble and scum, but they still have standards.\n\n**Haven:** The Bruja own and/or subsidize several out-of-the-way roadhouses and all-but-abandoned motels out there across the wastelands of the Southwest. They paid for the places with drug money or took them over as a result of too-successful protection rackets, and they’ve converted them into serviceable, sunlight-proof flophouses. These places aren’t much to look at and they have a fair market value of zero dollars, but they aren’t on any maps, and they’re within easy riding distance of (if not each other, at least) some great places to hang out, to have a drink or to get into a fight.\n\n**Background:** At its current size, the Bruja gang has adopted a fairly strict rule about not Embracing anyone else unless existing vampires drop out. It happens, though, and when it does, it usually happens to people who are already like the rest of the gang. That is to say, big, tough, hard-riding sons of bitches (or just actual bitches) who want to drink blood and kick ass for the rest of eternity. They’re not above occasionally Embracing (or at least creating Vinculums for) criminal contacts for the sake of expediency, and a handful of the really tough hangers-on were random hitchhikers, family men or police officers who got picked up and turned on some cruel whim.\n\nThe Bruja are somewhat lax about taking Gangrel they’ve never met before into the gang, since it hardly ever happens anyway. All a prospective Bruja has to do is earn the local head man’s respect (likely by surviving a surprise Bruja beatdown), prove he’s connected by blood to Bruja himself, then pony up a bike and get ready to ride out and meet the other boys and girls. Sounds easy, but if the rest of the gang doesn’t like him, the Bruja-wannabe starts back over at step beatdown.\n\n**Character Creation:** Bruja vampires don’t tend to be intellectual powerhouses, but neither are they entirely thuggish, apelike brutes. Granted, the bloodline does boast a high percentage of that ilk, but its nominal leaders are just as charismatic and commanding as they are powerful and tough (if not more so). As such, Physical and Social Attributes run a tight race with each other, with Mental ones lagging behind. Most Bruja rely on Physical Skills above all others, followed by Social and Mental as the individual sees fit. Various Social Merits help represent the breadth of the Bruja’s criminal operations and the influence and impact they have on the communities they terrorize. It also makes sense to buy at least a second dot of Blood Potency since a character’s just a punk Gangrel without it.\n\n**Bloodline Disciplines:** Animalism, Protean, Resilience, Vigor\n\n**Weakness:** Founded in indolence and caring little for anything other than their own well-being, the Bruja are given to the same feral urges that infect and overtake their Gangrel forebears. Their predatory laziness has a more serious effect on them, however, when it comes to feeding. Like many predators in the animal kingdom, the Bruja would rather stuff themselves as soon as the opportunity to feed presents itself than hunt carefully every night to maintain a baseline satiation. As a result, a player suffers a -3 penalty on rolls to resist the Wassail (hunger frenzy).\n\n**Organization:** The extended pack mentality of the gang is the extent to which the Bruja adhere to any form of organization. The founder’s closest companions are nominally in charge for now, but only until Bruja deigns to come back and start tearing up the road with his boys again. Said companions constantly vie for dominance among one another, and their bickering polarizes the followers around them, but the gang as a whole puts up a pretty unified front. They’re practically of one mind against outsiders who try to give a Bruja any shit, and even the occasional knockdown, drag-out between Bruja rarely results in more than somebody getting a baseball bat across the teeth or a switchblade under his collar bone.\n\n**Concepts:** Bar brawler, blood-doll pimp, coyote (in the illegal-border-crossing sense), dealer in drugged blood, dragracer, drug dealer, loan shark, motorcycle mechanic, perpetual omega wolf', 'violents', 2, 235, 2, NULL, 'GangrelBruja-6387b85e3b737.webp'),
(9, 'Burakumin', 'A bloodline of Japanese origin, the Burakumin consist largely of former laborers and other traditionally oppressed folk, who have found power in the distant West.', 'The Nosferatu bloodline that has come to be known as the Burakumin originated in feudal Japan within the social stratum of the same name. Beneath the samurai and the soldiers and the priests and even peasant farmers were those mortals whose professions were considered “spiritually unclean” by the tenets of the Shinto and Buddhist religions. Such professions included tanning, leather-working, butchery and the handling of dead bodies. People who made their living from these professions were declared unclean and legally worth less than other people, and grouped in small hamlets far from their spiritually poor neighbors. (Roughly translated, in fact, the word burakumin means “hamlet people.”) Considered equally impure and valueless by the Kindred Princes of the Eastern domains, Japanese Nosferatu were restricted from feeding on or Embracing from anyone outside that same class of mortal. In time, all of Japan’s Nosferatu were referred to as Burakumin, and the name and stratification spread throughout much of Eastern Asia as Burakumin Nosferatu expanded their influence under the cover of various Japanese imperialistic advances.\n\nStrictly enforced by Kindred of higher station, these mandates kept Burakumin numbers small and hemmed in what influence they could garner over mortal politics. Their low numbers and popular concentration greatly aided in the development of their uniquely grisly necromantic Discipline. As more Burakumin throughout the Eastern Courts learned it, they found that they were able to exert greater influence in their society and even to wrest occasional grudging concession from their superiors. One such concession was the right for their Prisci to petition the Princes of their domains for redress of grievances committed against individuals by younger Kindred of higher station.\n\nThe Meiji Restoration abolished official discrimination against mortal burakumin in Japan in the late 1800s, but where mortals have been slow to do away with their prejudices, vampires are stagnant. The changes in the social climate that have swept past them in the century since have not alleviated the restrictions and conditions placed on Kindred Burakumin. Instead, they have had to strike out on their own and forge their own destiny. Leaving their home domains by the handful ever since Commodore Perry “helped” open trade with the West to Japan, Burakumin have worked subtly to insinuate themselves into positions of influence over major exporters of raw materials. They also worked to gain a small but significant degree of influence over certain manufacturing concerns in the early 1900s as Japan became thoroughly industrialized.\n\nAlthough their status in the East was limited, the Burakumin’s wealth and influence in the West grew considerably. And when Japan struggled to rebuild its collapsed economy and industry after World War II, the Burakumin’s various holdings and enterprises were best suited to bouncing back and achieving relative stability. It was also the Burakumin who were most willing to leave their home domains and seek wealth and influence overseas in areas of exporting and industrial outsourcing. In the West, they’ve come to find status and respect that has long been denied them, and the support they are able to lend their compatriots back East has greatly improved their standing in the eyes of many local Princes.\n\nAnd in domains where the Burakumin’s industrial and financial influence (or meddling, depending on who you ask) is not as welcome, they can still earn respect and recognition for teaching their unique Discipline or using it to profitable effect.\n\n**Parent Clan:** Nosferatu\n\n**Nickname:** Unclean\n\n**Covenant:** In the Far East where it originated, this bloodline has traditionally been forced to remain unaligned. Most remnants of the Circle of the Crone covenant were wiped out long ago in favor of Shinto and Buddhist belief structures (or ones as similar to them as local Kindred could bring themselves to uphold). For much the same reason, the Lancea Sanctum has only very recently taken root there, and thus has never been of much interest to the Burakumin — though Kindred roundly disapprove of the unwholesome practice of their necromancies. The local version of the Invictus still proves resistant to accepting the Burakumin, but Western members of that covenant are considerably less so. Many Western Princes fear the strange power that the Burakumin wield, so they graciously invite Burakumin into their domains and grant them rights undreamed of back home. They do so largely to distract and placate these outsiders in an attempt to keep them docile, content and under control, but most Burakumin have been slow to realize how they are being played. The Ordo Dracul goes largely unnoticed by the Burakumin, but the ones who know about it find it baffling and more than a little oblique. The covenant that has had the most impact on Kindred of this bloodline, though, is the Carthian Movement. It proposes a state of true equality in which every vampire is entitled to an equal share in the spoils of the night, which is what the most vocal and active Burakumin have fought for since well before the Meiji Restoration. Carthian ideals have caught on like wildfire in the once-closed Eastern domains, and the Burakumin who introduced them enjoy an upwelling of underground status and influence unlike any they have ever known.\n\n**Appearance:** All Burakumin Kindred tend to exude the same disturbing, unclean, inhuman presence, which grows more obvious as their age and Blood Potency increases. As they age, they begin to reek of grave soil, and a stifling tomblike quiet emanates from them when they don’t consciously speak or make noise to counteract it. What’s more, their bodies take on a corpselike aspect that no amount of Vitae can ever banish completely. Over time, their skin withers and grows leathery until it’s no more than a parchment-thin veneer stretched taut over knobby bone. Out of dignified indifference to this condition (or sometimes out of a sense of perverse irony), most Burakumin dress and comport themselves with fastidious attention to detail. They do the best they can to make favorable impressions on Kindred around them so as to set prospective allies and business partners at ease (in the West) and to keep from giving anyone specific evidence to support unfavorable prejudices (in the East). Elder Burakumin in the East tend to favor garb that harks back to the mortal styles of the late Tokugawa Shogunate and early Meiji Era, while younger and more progressive Burakumin prefer more severe and formal Western professional attire.\n\n**Haven:** Eastern Burakumin have traditionally been restricted to communal havens in isolated hamlets populated by those mortals who are considered “unclean” by the tenets of the Shinto and Buddhist religions. Young and more urbanized ones dwell in and beneath large cities, yet well away from Kindred of higher station. Westward-looking Burakumin often wind up competing with local Nosferatu for havens, but as they grow more successful, their new homes come to rival those of the Daeva and the Ventrue.\n\n**Background:** Elder Eastern Burakumin mostly select progeny from among the societal class of the “unclean from which they themselves were once chosen. More cynical, bitter ones choose from among the beautiful, noble, powerful or traditionally pious in order to spite those who consider themselves so much more pure than the Burakumin. Bloodline members in the West have not made it a habit by and large to Embrace childer, but when they do, they choose those who can help them achieve their business and political goals and to adapt to their foreign environment.\n\n**Character Creation:** Burakumin don’t tend to have high Social Attributes, especially those who remain in Eastern domains. Neither do they place a particularly high priority on Physical Attributes. Their mental prowess has won them the niche in which they thrive, which leads them to favor Mental Attributes and Skills. Many of them tend to value Social Skills as well, although those propensities do not come as naturally to them. According to their weakness, Status is not a particularly economical buy up front, but other Social Merits (as well as certain Mental ones) can be worthwhile. It also makes sense to buy a second dot of Blood Potency since a character can’t officially join this bloodline or learn Getsumei until then.\n\n**Bloodline Disciplines:** Getsumei, Nightmare, Obfuscate, Vigor\n\n**Weakness:** Despite the unique power that the Discipline of Getsumei grants, and the relatively newfound wealth and influence it enjoys beyond its traditional cultural borders, the Burakumin bloodline is a decidedly unlucky one. Not only does it share the weakness of its wider parent clan (though a specific variety of it), but it also suffers social stigmas unrelated to its ghastly appearance. Like other Nosferatu, players of Burakumin cannot re-roll 10’s for additional successes on Presence- or Manipulation-ba sed rolls, and 1’s subtract from successes on those rolls. This weakness is due to the fact that Burakumin closely resemble the decaying corpses that they should be. Upon the Embrace, the Burakumin take on the appearance of cold, hours-dead bodies, and they cannot mimic the appearance of vital life with the expenditure of Vitae. As their Blood Potency increases, their bodies appear to wither and decay as per the natural stages of human decomposition (only matching the pace of the vampire’s progression). This appearance of decay does not hinder the physical functions of the vampire’s body (even though flesh might constrict and split, revealing bone beneath).\n\nAside from this physical affliction, the Burakumin must deal with a social penalty as well. Try as they might to build up resources and increase their influence among mortals, line members have trouble fitting in and earning a standing comparable to that of their fellow Kindred. In their cultural homeland, they suffer the long-standing prejudices of an undying elite that cannot keep up with the pace of modern society. While they earn more respect in the West, they suffer a different sort of prejudice for being not only an offshoot of the Nosferatu, but foreigners as well. Young Kindred don’t tend to hold such prejudices, but they don’t tend to be the ones with all the power and influence in the domains in which the Burakumin seek to insinuate themselves. As a result of these various prejudices, purchasing the Status Merit (in all of its forms) costs double.\n\n**Organization:** In their Eastern homes, Burakumin have little choice but to come together with others of their own kind, lest they face a Requiem of maddening solitude. Individual Burakumin defer to regional Prisci, who communicate with ministers responsible for passing on edicts from local Princes. Priscus is usually the highest station to which a Burakumin can hope to rise in the East, and though it conveys significant status among other Burakumin, that status isn’t worth quite as much to anyone else. Moving West, these Kindred stick together for the sake of familiarity among strangers and in strange lands, but they adhere to no established internal hierarchy. Some scatter to the four winds, never looking back, while others fall in with other kinds of Nosferatu, lacking the ability to adapt sufficiently to their new environments to forge their own destinies.\n\n**Concepts:** Ancestral avenger, aspiring upstart Primogen, blackmailer, forensic pathologist, grave robber, importer, mortician, private investigator, spectral intercessor, tanner', 'Corpse', 2, 238, 4, NULL, 'LogoBurakumin-638801599251e.webp'),
(10, 'Malkovian', 'A Russian-descended bloodline that inflicts insightful madness on its bearers, feared and reviled by other Ventrue.', 'Most Kindred are still unaware of the so-called “Malkovian” bloodline and its peculiar, threatening gifts. The Lunatics are few — a state of affairs that those who are aware of them would like to perpetuate, by whatever means necessary.\n\nAmong worried Ventrue elders, the story of the Malkovians’ origins is now verified. It seems that a certain Dr. James Griffin Hartleigh of England’s Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum once became a bit too interested in one of his patients, an Anton Malkov. Malkov was rumored to be related to the czars of Russia, which was a chief reason, Hartleigh believed, why Malkov had been transported to Broadmoor under cover of night. (After all, the asylum hosted many such inmates whose whereabouts were a secret to all but their embarrassed and wealthy families.) Hartleigh never learned the details of the wretch’s crime, but the director had strictly enjoined him never to touch Malkov nor look him in the eye. Moreover, despite being a recluse who rarely left his dark cell, Malkov seemed to exert a strange fascination over the other madmen. Hartleigh found him an intriguing case, and their rambling interviews only fired his interest. Evidently Malkov felt the same way. Or, at least, it’s the only reason anyone can think of why he chose to Embrace the staid doctor.\n\nHartleigh stumbled home that same night and murdered his wife. Even now he cannot precisely recall what moved him to do so. True, he had always entertained certain doubts about her and the cook, but... well, never mind that. When he came to and found himself greedily sucking her blood, even such a font of Reason had to admit that something was much amiss. After hastily covering up his deed (which unfortunately required a further murder), Hartleigh stole back to the asylum to demand an explanation from Malkov. The lunatic drove him away with his mocking, echoing laughter. The doctor never dared return.\n\nAfter some months of painstaking investigation, Hartleigh tracked down a solitary old gentleman whom he had seen mentioned in Malkov’s papers. This worthy was, alas, unforthcoming. Indeed, he seemed quite piqued to learn where the errant Malkov had secreted himself, and he waxed outright wroth as Hartleigh inquired whether he and Malkov were kin and whether there was any family history of insanity or blood-diseases of which he was aware. At last the Ventrue grew exasperated with this embarrassing mistake of a grandchilde and reached into Hartleigh’s mind. But in the intimacy of psychic contact, Hartleigh reflexively reached back — and found something he could twist. With startling ease, he sent the elder Kindred into a fugue state not at all unlike the one in which he himself had behaved so regrettably.\n\nHartleigh has since Embraced several childer — doctors to “consult” and lordlings to infiltrate the Ventrue to seek the answers he himself was denied by his scandalized clanmates. In time, some of those childer have gone astray from the fold, much as Malkov did, and begotten lineages of their own.\n\nTo date, the bloodline has made no serious attempt to claim the status theoretically due it as an innovation of the Blood; its particular creation seems profoundly unwelcome. The Ventrue resent the attention the Malkovians draw to their own mental instability, and since Ventrue and Malkovians are sometimes hard to tell apart, few Lords dare discount the horrifying possibility of a hidden contamination of the entire clan. Many vampires of other broods are also inclined to go mad with time, and they certainly don’t want any “help” in doing so. For those who aren’t so inclined, their minds are the last sanctuary they have, the one thing they can still rely on after their bodies have transformed so monstrously and their instincts have fallen prey to the Beast. And so most Lunatics wisely endeavor to pass their Requiems in such a way as to avoid rousing their fellow Kindred’s ire. Of course, even the most unassuming Malkovian occasionally find himself plagued by someone who seems to deserve a taste of the curse he’s tried so hard to bear nobly.\n\nAs for Malkov, Broadmoor records claim that a fellow inmate killed him in 1889.\n\n**Parent Clan:** Ventrue\n\n**Nickname:** Among those rare non-Ventrue who know of them, the Malkovians are nicknamed Lunatics. When the Ventrue mention them at all (generally only to other Ventrue), they refer to them obliquely as “our most charming cousins,” or sometimes as “the escapees.”\n\n**Covenant:** A fair majority of Malkovians pretend to be something else (generally Ventrue), so they usually favor whatever covenant allegiance makes the most sense for their assumed identities. As a result, many (if not most) belong to the Invictus. The fanatical bent of the Lancea Sanctum also appeals to some Malkovians, particularly those who suffer obsessions or visions. Some petition to join the Circle of the Crone or the Ordo Dracul, hoping for the relief that mystic wisdom might bring, but they are usually marginalized sometime during the initiation process. Rare indeed is the Malkovian whose madness strikes either covenant as an aid to enlightenment rather than a sad liability. After all, the tests and trial periods that both covenants set are explicitly designed to ferret out just such inner obstacles. As Malkovians grow weary of vainly searching for acceptance in the more established circles of Kindred society, it’s likely that more and more of them will show up in the ranks of the Carthians and the unaligned.\n\n**Appearance:** Malkovians with enough self-command to recognize what they are and what afflicts them often go to some trouble to appear as anything but. Clothes might be fastidious and well coordinated — indeed, even suspiciously pristine. Among those who aspire to Ventrue status, styles appealing to elder tastes are favored. Other Lunatics are too... preoccupied with other matters to attend to such trivialities as vestment. Some can explain the etiquette of gloves and soliloquize on why stirrup pants are an abomination before God and man, but they haven’t the slightest idea what’s wrong with a morning coat that hasn’t been dry-cleaned or mended since 1932.\n\n**Haven:** Discretion is the key consideration for a Malkovian haven. After all, most Kindred require privacy, but should a Malkovian start to have a bad evening, he really needs a safe retreat where neither easily shocked mortals nor judgmental Kindred can pry. Many Lunatics adapt family homes or vacation homes to this purpose. Such places are often left to slide into a sort of genteel decay, which helps the isolation along. Others rely on the comforting anonymity of cookie-cutter apartment complexes. More outré domiciles like old fallout shelters or church attics aren’t unheard of. In any case, once settled, a haven quickly comes to enshrine its resident’s quirks, manias, idols and fears. While one area within might be scrubbed clean of incriminating detritus and kept suitable for entertaining, the greater part of any Malkovian’s home is a veritable treasure trove and museum on the subject of him.\n\n**Background:** Motivations for Malkovian Embraces vary as widely as those for any other clan or bloodline. Company in misery is a frequent one. Sometimes a Lunatic hopes that his new childe (be that childe a psychiatrist, priest, mother or simply someone who made the mistake of being kind to the vampire once) will be able to help him with his ailment, or at the very least will have the psychic strength to somehow overcome the madness and so purge the bloodline of its taint. Other sires, like their Ventrue forebears, pride themselves on selectivity, so erudite scholars and folk of “quality” are inducted.\n\nAt present, the very idea of a willing Ventrue seeking adoption into the ranks of the Malkovians is an absurdity to both bloods. Occasional rumors surface, however, of Malkovians who have made “converting” a certain Ventrue — in other words, fracturing her mind to the point where joining the Malkovians seems like a good idea, or the only idea — their pet project. So far, no such catechumens have shown up on the doorstep of Dr. Hartleigh. Much to his relief.\n\n**Character Creation:** Mental and Social Attributes are usually primary. (After all, there’s no correlation whatsoever between being mad and being dumb, though ignorant Kindred frequently make the mistake. The line hosts many an adroit manipulator and charming psychopath.) Malkovians whose Physical Attributes predominate are uncommon but not unheard of. Malkovians generally favor Mental and Social Skills as well; Academics, Science, Expression, Empathy and Investigation are particularly useful. Malkovians often possess the same Social Merits as their Ventrue cousins. Most Mental Merits are appropriate (except for Common Sense). Also, be sure to take at least a second dot of Blood Potency, to allow the character to be at all eligible for a bloodline.\n\nA Malkovian’s core derangement is key to her makeup. Mortals with mental illnesses are far more than the sum of their ailments, but a Malkovian’s curse is no mundane affliction. It runs in her very Blood. In all likelihood, it eventually consumes her soul. Accordingly, much care should be given to choosing and understanding it. Read up on mental illness; steep in literary traditions of madness, particularly the gothic tradition. Mental illness is a serious real-life issue that should be regarded respectfully, but don’t feel obliged to make your character a textbook DSM-IV diagnosis. It’s more important that derangement amplifies and enriches character, theme and story (rather than derails them).\n\n**Bloodline Disciplines:** Auspex, Dominate, Obfuscate, Resilience\n\n**Weakness:** Malkovians suffer the Ventrue clan weakness (-2 penalty to Humanity rolls to avoid acquiring derangements after failing a degeneration roll). In addition, all Malkovians must take a “core” derangement that is theirs for eternity. This derangement may not be cured, reduced in severity or bought off no matter how high the character’s Humanity soars. It could certainly become more severe, however.\n\nThis core derangement is also susceptible to being “set off” or aggravated whenever the character uses Dominate. If a Discipline roll is anything other than an ordinary success, the character experiences a bout of his core derangement at some point that night (or first thing the next night if the roll in question occurs too close to dawn). In other words, failures, dramatic failures and exceptional successes all cause this effect. Furthermore, in the case of a dramatic failure, a mild derangement is upgraded to its more severe version for the remainder of the night. (Storytellers, be sensible about this. The middle of a combat in which four goons attack a Malkovian with napalm is not a good time to decree that he curls up into a fetal ball on the floor. The middle of the Prince’s salon later that night is a different story.)\n\n**Organization:** The relative level of cooperation among Malkovians varies. There are now Malkovians who don’t consciously realize their true heritage. In some lineages, a series of desultory or irrational Embraces has produced neonates who feel only disregard for others of their bloodline — or even outright hatred for them. In others, however, sires and grandsires still maintain a more secretive version of the age-old bonds. They gladly provide mentoring, counseling and comfort in exchange for their descendants’ compliance in their schemes. Malkovians with sires who are too distracted to cultivate them often seek out an “aunt” or “cousin” to fulfill that role instead.\n\nOccasionally, sophisticated collaborations to study and cure the bloodline’s maladies arise. Doctors, pharmacologists, psychologists, mystics and historians keeping each other informed of their discoveries through discreet correspondence. Of course, close contact among Malkovians has other hazards besides just the danger of interference from fearful Kindred. Madness can be contagious, and often it only takes one brilliant mind’s descent into unreason to drag the entire effort down.\n\n**Concepts:** Absinthe-addled roué, Arsenic and Old Lacestyle death angel, conspiracy theorist, eccentric scholar, failed suicide, health professional, idiot savant, mumbling beggar, religious visionary, scion of decaying noble line, tortured artist', 'Lunatic', 2, 241, 5, NULL, 'LogoMalkovian-638804d0d3694.webp');

(11, 'Morbus', 'An ancient and infamous bloodline which can only feed on the sick and dying, a condition which they themselves may inflict with impunity.', 'For as long as the Kindred have been aware of the existence of the Morbus, bloodline historians and vampiric genealogists have been frustrated by them. Owing largely to the rarity of extensive records cataloguing Mekhet lineage over the centuries, no one can pin down exactly who the founder of this bloodline might have been or where the first niche was in which the Morbus began to thrive. The idea of constructing a truly inclusive history of the Kindred (especially as regards the Mekhet clan) from which one might solve this mystery conclusively is a pipe dream at best, but some aspire to it nonetheless. Those Morbus who choose to concern themselves with the subject consider this ongoing failure a relief and a legitimatization of their entire existence. They see themselves as simply Mekhet who are afflicted or cursed with a singular variety of rarefied tastes.\n\nThe particular preference to which the Morbus are all suspect is that they must feed on the blood of the ailing and diseased in order to sustain their vital undead state. In fact, the name Morbus comes from a Latin root meaning “diseased,” which was ascribed to afflicted Mekhet by non-afflicted ones during the reign of Justinian in the sixth century AD. According to records from that period unearthed centuries later by Kindred archaeologists, the Morbus were suspected of either spreading or helping to spread a virulent plague across the Mediterranean in one domain after another. Less solvent data has linked named Morbus from Roman records with Mekhet who were active in Greece and Egypt as far back as 430 BC, a year in which plague was said to have struck Athens. The connection this data implies is tenuous as best, and possibly wholly fabricated as propaganda against the Morbus. Nonetheless, it might have been possible for the Kindred to accept the Morbus condition as just a peculiar feeding preference if it were not for records recovered from Constantinople dating back to AD 1334. At that time, one of the most widespread plagues in history swept across Europe and Asia, aided by large numbers of soldiers and captives returning from the Crusades. The records in question describe the “righteous wrath” of a Mekhet pilgrim who traveled in secret with the Christian army. He returned to his domain once the campaign was ended to find his Kindred subjects in rebellion and his mortal herds mired hopelessly in sin. To punish them, records say, he blighted his people with a wasting sickness from within him that killed everyone for miles within a matter of days. This incident blended in with concurrent reports of blight and plague that swept the continent at the time, but Kindred historians pin it down as the first known instance of the use of the Morbus Discipline known as Cachexy.\n\nWhen captured and put to the question by Kindred Inquisitors for the act, this Kindred denied being the founder of a bloodline at all. He claimed that he had learned his unusual abilities from his sire, who had long since succumbed to the sleep of ages. When he awoke much later, the Kindred’s sire also denied developing the Discipline or founding a bloodline, but his memories of his own sire or brood brethren were too hazy to offer any more definitive leads. These records are the closest any historian has come to finding the bloodline’s true founder or tracing its evolution. Tonight, most Morbus are not as concerned with their origins as they are with survival. Once they discover their condition and the unique power that derives from it (or they have both explained to them by an older Morbus), they must decide whether to hide it or admit what they are and try to redefine their niche. Their ability to do either varies by domain, but if nothing else, periodic outbreaks of severe infectious diseases throughout history and all over the world provide sufficient vessels on which to thrive. All they have to do is keep informed and be willing to risk travel to areas in which untreated strains of infectious disease defy the cutting edge of First-World medicine.\n\n**Parent Clan:** Mekhet\n\n**Nickname:** Carriers\n\n**Covenant:** Many Carriers find it difficult to make a respected name or to carve out a fruitful place among the undead of the Invictus or the Lancea Sanctum once their affliction becomes known. Kindred consider them threats to the Traditions and claim that hundred-fold damnation awaits any Morbus who breaks the Third Tradition. Princes of the Invictus simply don’t want Carriers polluting their domains and weakening the mortal pillars of their power structure with careless feeding. Some Morbus take perverse pleasure in testing the limits of Carthian egalitarian tolerance, but most would just as soon cultivate as much power and influence as they can and tell the Carthians to go to hell. Repentant or remorseful Carriers turn to members of the Circle of the Crone in hopes of finding some way to undo the curse they’ve wrought upon themselves, but no member of the bloodline or the covenant in general has yet uncovered any hope that such is possible. Others join the Ordo Dracul in an attempt to progress beyond the weakness that their blood inflicts, but no Morbus has yet achieved the true transcendence that the Order espouses. The rest of the bloodline hide out among the Kindred of the Invictus or the Lancea Sanctum — guarding the secret of their heritage for all their unlives are worth — or go it alone among the unaligned.\n\n**Appearance:** Most Morbus adopt attire based on how they intend to interact with Kindred society vis-à-vis their condition. Those who try to pass as “normal” often play to the stereotypes that they feel are expected of their clan in their chosen covenant and domain. In fact, they often overdo said stereotypes and give themselves away. Those whose nature is fairly common knowledge try to keep a low profile in “urban camouflage” (i.e., plain, baggy, off-brand clothes in neutral colors), so as to not stand out and risk being social lightning rods. Those who are outright cavalier about their bloodline — and have found acceptance in a Prince’s domain — often play to Mekhet stereotypes. They do so out of a desire to show how successful they can be despite their condition.\n\n**Haven:** Whether they’re covert or open about what they are, Morbus make just as much of an effort to make their havens a reflection of their personal purposes as other Mekhet do. The only way in which they choose havens that differs is they look for ones among or offering easy access to diseased mortal vessels.\n\n**Background:** It is a more frequent for a Mekhet to Embrace a childe who then realizes he is a Morbus than it is for a confirmed Morbus to Embrace a childe. Most Morbus childer therefore have the same backgrounds as non-afflicted Mekhet. When the Morbus do Embrace deliberately, they tend to choose doctors (whom they vainly hope can help cure them), dying vessels to whom they’ve formed obsessive attachments, or people with influence over policymakers.\n\n**Character Creation:** The priority assigned to Physical Attributes and Skills is largely a matter of personal taste, as these vampires do not necessarily need sterner constitutions to balance the diseases they carry. The choice between Mental and Social Attributes and Skills should depend on how open a character is to revealing his lineage and how he intends to adapt to his condition. It is also wise to buy up or sell off Humanity dots based on how cavalier uses of Cachexy will be, or how humane a function he considers feeding from the sick and infirm to be. Also, don’t forget to buy a second dot of Blood Potency since a character can’t officially join the bloodline before then.\n\n**Bloodline Disciplines:** Auspex, Cachexy, Celerity, Obfuscate\n\n**Weakness:** The Morbus are slaves to a highly rarefied palate. Only the blood of diseased and dying mortals sustains them, while healthy blood turns to ash in their mouths (though they may take Kindred Vitae and be nourished by it as normal). They can feed from other vessels only when frenzying, but doing so does not replenish their Vitae to any degree whatsoever. Some Morbus feel compelled to drink blood infected with only one specific disease, but this restriction is only a matter of taste or a psychological limitation. Should such a member be brave or desperate enough to drink from a victim with a different affliction than his preferred one, he suffers no penalty. While these diseases don’t adversely affect the Morbus themselves (usually), they can occasionally be transmitted when the Kindred feed, share blood with their ghouls or have sex.\n\nThe Morbus bloodline is a shameful aberration in the eyes of most Mekhet, which makes it all but impossible for a confirmed Morbus to gain any Status Merit or clan offices among the non-afflicted. What’s more, a surviving descendent of a confirmed Morbus who is not a member of the bloodline stands to lose standing by association, both from Mekhet who expect him to follow in his ancestor’s footsteps and from other Morbus who wonder why he’s afraid to do so.\n\n**Organization:** The tradition among certain elders and Kindred genealogists of tracking descent and lineage both informs and works against the Morbus. A few members trace lineage and determine intra-bloodline status based on the relative fame or notoriety of sires and grandsires. Some consider the achievements of only their confirmed Morbus forebears worthy of consideration, while others uphold any Mekhet ancestors’ accomplishments. Morbus who manage to keep their membership in this bloodline a secret, and earn status and respect from other Mekhet, earn the same again (and more) from their Morbus peers for their cleverness.\n\n**Concepts:** Angel of mercy, cult leader, demon of retribution, doctor, hospice manager, medical researcher, New-Age holistic healer, plague dog, retirement-home orderly, seemingly philanthropic political activist', 'Disease carriers', 2, 245, 3, NULL, 'MekhetMorbus-638806d7610f0.webp');

(1, 'clan', 'Each Kindred is a member of a clan. A clan is a group of vampires who all share common characteristics. Popular Kindred mythology suggests that all vampires are assumed to have descended from one common Kindred, the founder of that clan, though no one knows who those founders might be. When a vampire Embraces a new Kindred, the progeny is of the same clan as the progenitor. Certain “sub-clans” of vampires also exist, known as bloodlines, but a vampire can never change her clan.\r\n\r\nA clan is a vampiric lineage. The Kindred acknowledge five clans, and all Kindred belong to one clan or another. The most widely accepted theory regarding clans is that they are like “families” of vampires. Members of clans all inherit certain mystical commonalities, from acumen with certain Disciplines to traditional shortcomings for their particular type. One of the failings of the “families” theory is that none of the clan progenitors are reliably known, and only a few are guessed at with any degree of confidence. Certainly, the clans came from somewhere — but where? In a modern context, only two Kindred are known to have no clan, and they haven’t reliably demonstrated that they’ve been able to Embrace over the course of their Requiems. These vampires, the legendary Dracula and the Roman centurion Longinus are responsible for the creation of certain covenants, not clans, but might they be on a path toward clan creation themselves? And if the origin of clans doesn’t lie with certain progenitor vampires, from what source do clans originate? If Longinus and Dracula have no clan, who’s to say that other, more secretive Kindred haven’t also suffered the curse in the same way?\r\n\r\nTonight, the influence of the clans is felt almost everywhere. The five clans have a presence throughout the Western world, or so it is believed. The Kindred definitely came to the New World along with the early colonists, suggesting that these vampires are European in origin, or that they grew out of the civilizations that first populated the world and followed the movements of mortal men. Oral histories and sparse records indicate that some vampiric presence existed among the tribal cultures of North America before its colonization, but whether these creatures were members of clans or solitary, unique beings — or even if they were truly vampires at all — cannot be determined. While information on the Far East is fleeting, members of the five clans are known to be active there, as they are in Africa, South America and much of the Middle East. Still, little is known about how indigenous culture shapes the understanding of clans in all these regions, and anyone attempting to study the phenomenon is probably wise to take no presuppositions with him.\r\n\r\nA bloodline is like a clan, but its characteristics are not so universal. It might help to think of a bloodline as a “sub-clan.” Not all vampires are members of bloodlines. Each bloodline has a parent clan from which it distinctly diverges, yet claims descent. Kindred scholars have no reliable estimates of how many bloodlines exist in the world tonight, because bloodlines can arise at any time and few of them would stand up to be counted, even if some formal roster of them were made.\r\n');

(1, 'Animalism', 'Although most look human, all the Kindred conceal within them a feral predator, a Beast that divides all others into only two categories: threat or prey.\r\n\r\nSome Kindred feel their affinity with the animals of the world, and their connection with their own animalistic nature to a greater degree than others.\r\n\r\nThese Kindred often develop the Discipline of Animalism, which allows them to bond with the beasts — and the Beasts— around them.', 0, 'They can not only commune with lower creatures, but project their will upon them, forcing them to obey.\n\nAs the Kindred gain power, some develop the ability to join with animals, or to influence the Beast lurking with their own souls or the souls of other vampires.\n\nMost Kindred are **repellent to animals**. Lesser creatures grow agitated in the presence of the undead and normally flee the scene (or, in some cases, attack the vampire in question). Kindred who possess Animalism are a very different story. Animals are often attracted to such Kindred, and **their presence is soothing** even to restless beasts.\n\nOther sentient, supernatural beings such as shapechangers who have animal form or who can assume animal form are **not** affected by **Animalism**. Their intelligence makes them the purview of the Dominate Discipline. Similarly, Animalism is **useless** on another vampire who assumes wolf or another bestial form. Animalism is of no avail to the vampire in regard to such intelligent beings.\n\nNote that any Animalism power that requires eye contact is made **more difficult if the subject does not stand still** or is not otherwise immobilized. If the animal in question moves about, the roll to initiate the relevant power suffers a **-1 penalty** in addition to all others listed.', NULL, 2, NULL, 'Control over animals'),
(2, 'Auspex', 'This potent Discipline grants a character superlative sensory capabilities. At the lowest levels, it sharpens a Kindred’s mundane senses. As one progresses in mastery, entirely new avenues of insight open up before the user. Ultimately, this is the Discipline of gleaning information, whether that data comes from sights and smells, from auras and patterns of energy or directly from the mind of another creature.', 1, 'Auspex can be used to pierce the veil of powers that cloud, dissemble and deceive (see Clash of Wills). Indeed, precious little can be kept secret from a true master of Auspex.\n\nOnce in a while, this uncanny Discipline provides extrasensory and even precognitive visitations. Such premonitions might come as quick flashes of imagery, overwhelming feelings of empathy or even as an ominous sense of foreboding. The Kindred has absolutely no control over these insights, but he can learn to interpret their significance given time and experience.\n\nSuch potent sensitivity can have its drawbacks, however. When a vampire actively uses any level of Auspex save the fifth (Twilight Projection), he runs the risk of his delicate senses being overwhelmed by excessive stimuli. Sudden or severe occurrences such as a gun report or flash bulb in the eyes can distract the character unless the player succeeds on a **Resolve roll**. Failure disorients the character, making him effectively **unaware of his surroundings until the end of the following turn**.', NULL, 2, NULL, 'Sharpened senses'),
(3, 'Celerity', 'Tales and legends of vampires ascribe to them inhuman speed, the ability to move faster than the eye can see, and even to appear in two places at once. While some of those accounts are exaggerated, Kindred with the Discipline of Celerity can indeed move far faster than any mortal. They appear to blur into nothingness, all others moving as if in slow motion in comparison.', 0, '', NULL, 2, NULL, 'Extraordinary speed'),
(4, 'Dominate', 'Some Kindred are capable of overwhelming the minds of others with their own force of will, influencing actions and even thoughts.', 1, 'Use of Dominate requires a character to capture a victim’s gaze. The Discipline can therefore be used on only one subject at a time, and is **useless if eye contact is not possible**.\n\nDominate does not grant the ability to make oneself understood or to communicate mentally. Commands must be issued verbally, though certain simple commands (such as “Go over there!” indicated with a pointed finger and a forceful expression) may be conveyed by signs at the Storyteller’s discretion. No matter how powerful a vampire is, **she cannot force her victim to obey if she cannot make herself understood** — if, for example, the victim doesn’t speak the same language, she cannot hear or the orders simply make no sense.\n\nNote that victims of Dominate **might realize** what’s been done to them. That is, they do not automatically sense that they are being controlled, but they might subsequently wonder why they suddenly acted as they did. Wise Kindred, especially those familiar with Dominate, are likely to figure it out in the moment, and few vampires take kindly to being manipulated in such a fashion. Most Kindred who develop Dominate are forceful, controlling personalities, and they can make a reputation for themselves if they use this Discipline wantonly.\n\nIn all cases, a dramatic failure while attempting to Dominate a victim renders the would-be victim **immune to the character’s Dominate until the next sunset**.\n\nDominate is far more effective against mortals than it is against other Kindred. Most Dominate abilities described here allow the victim to struggle against the effects; that is, a contested roll is made against the Dominator’s player. As no mortal has Blood Potency, the vast majority of humans are at a disadvantage when dealing with the Discipline.\n\nDominate is also more effective against those whom the user has subjected to a Vinculum. A regnant may use Dominate powers (with the exception of Conditioning) on a thrall **without the need for eye contact**; the thrall merely has to hear the regnant’s voice.\n\nOther sentient, supernatural beings such as shapechangers who have animal form or who can assume animal form are affected by Dominate rather than by Animalism. A vampire can therefore try to ply his will on a werewolf — even a werewolf in wolf form — by using Dominate. Similarly, Animalism is useless against another vampire who assumes wolf or another bestial form. Animalism is of no avail to the vampire in regard to such intelligent beings.\n\nNote that any Dominate power requiring eye contact is made more difficult if the subject is not standing still or otherwise immobilized. If the target moves about, the roll to initiate the relevant power suffers a **-1 penalty** in addition to all others listed.', NULL, 2, NULL, 'Control over humans'),
(5, 'Majesty', 'One of the most legendary powers of the undead is the ability to attract, sway and control the emotions of others, especially those of mortals. Majesty is perhaps the most versatile of Disciplines, for its potential uses and applications are both varied and multitudinous. The more savvy the practitioner, the more use he can get out of each of the Discipline’s levels.', 1, 'Unlike some other Disciplines, Majesty can be used on entire crowds of targets simultaneously, making it even more potent— in the right hands.\n\nThe only requirement for use of most Majesty powers is that **any potential targets see the character**. Eye contact is not required, nor is the ability to hear the character (though it certainly doesn’t hurt).\n\nThe downside to Majesty, such as is it is, is that its subjects retain their free will. Unlike victims of Dominate, who follow the commands of the Kindred nearly mindlessly, those acting under Majesty are simply emotionally predisposed to do whatever the power (or its user) suggests. While retention of personality makes victims more useful in the long run, it also means they require more care in handling than targets of Dominate. An abused victim of Majesty certainly subverts or represses what his emotions suggest in order to behave in the most appropriate manner. Meanwhile, subjects treated well might be persuaded to act against even their own interests.\n\nAny mortal can resist Majesty for one turn if a Willpower point is spent and a successful Composure roll is made (though the Willpower point does not add three dice to the roll). This roll is reflexive. If the roll fails, the Willpower point is lost and the target remains under the effects of the power(s). If the roll is successful, the mortal probably spends his turn of “freedom” fleeing the vampire’s proximity, lest he continue to be affected. Refusing to pay attention to the vampire, rather than fleeing, can allow a mortal to resist the spell for a turn, but the power resumes effect if the mortal remains in the Kindred’s vicinity.\n\nVampires resist Majesty in much the same way (by spending a Willpower point), but Blood Potency is added to Composure rolls made for them. In addition, **vampires of higher Blood Potency than the character invoking Majesty are able to resist his power for the entire scene** with the expenditure of one Willpower point and a successful Composure + Blood Potency roll.\n\nBy and large, the Kindred who choose to develop their Majesty abilities are those who recognize that one achieves more with honey than with vinegar. Those who swear by Majesty often find Dominate, seen as “the flip side of Majesty,” to be both boorish and crass, and they would swear to calling upon it only in times of dire need.', NULL, 2, NULL, 'Control over emotions'),
(6, 'Nightmare', 'There’s no question that one of the foremost powers of legendary vampires is the ability to strike fear in the hearts of mortal men. Also born of mortal existence, other now-supernatural beings are susceptible. Fear is a fact of existence that transcends any origins.', 1, 'Vampires who delve into the dark side of their being —often exploring the Beast or what it means to be monstrous— invest in the Discipline of Nightmare. They learn to bear that which is terrifying or unholy about their spirits, manifesting their inhumanity in their appearance or letting unfortunate onlookers peer deep into the creatures’ depraved souls.\n\nThe results can take a jaded individual aback or subject an unsuspecting victim to a fatal physiological reaction (to literally be frightened to death).\n\nPractitioners of Nightmare explore this route to power for different reasons. One vampire might exult in his inhuman nature and enjoy lording over lessers. The Discipline offers immediate gratification, and these Kindred display what is hideous about themselves to everyone, hiding it only insofar as they must in order to observe the secrecy of the Traditions. Other undead recognize the wisdom or even benevolence that fear affords. What better way to deal with a problem or avoid a confrontation than by frightening away an opponent? How better to protect someone from harm than by scaring her off? And if one seeks solitude, striking fear is certainly more effective than issuing threats, trying to reason with would-be intruders or orchestrating ever more elaborate means by which to hide.\n\nAll uses of Nightmare gain a +2 bonus if the individual power is turned on a vampire with whom the user has a Blood Tie. Naturally, this bonus does not apply to the subject’s resistance.', NULL, 2, NULL, 'Control over fear'),
(7, 'Obfuscate', 'Night-dwellers, predators by nature and keepers of the Masquerade, vampires are inherently (and necessarily) creatures of secrecy and stealth. From hiding minute objects to the ability to appear as someone else to the power to fade from sight entirely, the Discipline of Obfuscate grants the Kindred uncanny powers of concealment, stealth and deception.', 0, 'Obfuscate clouds the mind in practice. For example, a character hiding an object by using this Discipline doesn’t actually make the object disappear, nor does someone using the Discipline to hide himself truly vanish. Rather, the mind sees “around” the Obfuscated object, refusing to acknowledge it, even if that requires a bit of filling in mental blanks. To continue the example, if a character Obfuscated a large sheet of plywood and tried to hide behind it herself, those looking at the plywood would, indeed, see the character lurking behind it but not see the plywood itself.\n\nThe shroud of Obfuscate is very difficult to penetrate. Few Kindred or other supernatural creatures can see through it, and only under the rarest of circumstances do mortals have any hope. Because they operate on a less conscious and mostly instinctual level, however, animals often perceive a vampire’s presence — and react with appropriate fear or hostility — even if they cannot detect him with their normal senses. Similarly, children, the mentally ill and others who see the world in ways not quite normal might pierce the deception at the Storyteller’s discretion.\n\nSome Kindred with Auspex are able to see through Obfuscate, or at least sense the presence of a supernatural deception. Refer to the “Clash of Wills” for details.\n\nIt’s important to note that Obfuscate affects the viewer’s mind, rather than making any true physical change to the vampire. Thus, the Discipline is not effective at cloaking a character from mechanical devices. Photographs, video cameras and the like record the normal blurred image that all vampires leave in such media, not the assumed appearance.\n\nObfuscate does affect any individual currently using the recording device, however, so someone videotaping an Obfuscated vampire sees the illusion when looking through the lens, discovering the truth only later when he reviews the tape itself.\n\nUnless stated otherwise, Obfuscate powers require very little concentration to maintain once invoked, and they last for the duration of a scene.', NULL, 2, NULL, 'Supernatural deception'),
(8, 'Protean', 'Easily one of the most overtly spectacular of the gifts of the Damned, the Discipline of Protean is the study of physical metamorphosis and transformation. The nature of this power is hotly debated among the Kindred, for its abilities are so varied while simultaneously stemming from no obvious aspect of the Curse. Whatever its cause or origin, Protean allows its masters to assume virtually any form or shape.', 1, 'Since the core of a vampire’s self doesn’t alter with his shape, a transformed Kindred can generally take any action or use any Discipline that his new form can reasonably allow. Gangrel in the form of a cloud of mist, for example, could read auras (as the sense of sight doesn’t vanish), but couldn’t Dominate someone effectively (as the prerequisite eye contact can no longer be established). A vampire’s clothes and personal effects change shape with him, but he cannot normally transmute especially large objects or other creatures.\n\nUnless stated otherwise, Protean powers — being permanent physical changes — last as long as the vampire wishes them to, or until he is forced into torpor. Any state that prevents the character from taking action (such as being staked) likewise prevents transformation; the vampire needs the freedom to invoke his will.', NULL, 2, NULL, 'Shapshifting abilities'),
(9, 'Resilience', 'Legends abound of vampires who are able to withstand even the most brutal punishment to their unliving forms. While all Kindred possess a certain degree of the toughness of which these tales speak, those with the Discipline of Resilience are commensurately more stalwart. Vampires with several dots of Resilience are capable of walking through a hail of bullets, shrugging off even the most punishing blows, and even resisting the deadly claws and fangs of supernatural foes.', 0, '', NULL, 2, NULL, 'Extraordinary resistance'),
(10, 'Vigor', 'Nearly every vampire legend across the globe expresses the preternatural strength possessed by the undead. In truth, not all Kindred possess such inhuman might, but the Discipline of Vigor makes those who do far more powerful than any mortal could ever hope to be. Vigor allows Kindred to strike opponents with the force of a falling boulder or speeding car; to lift enormous weights as though they were paper; to shatter concrete like glass; to leap distances so great that those elders with obscenely high levels of Vigor may, in fact, be responsible for legends of vampiric flight.', 0, '', NULL, 2, NULL, 'Extraordinary Strength'),
(11, 'Path of Blood', 'Bob allow Anastasia to benefit more power from blood, to play with it, be it hers or other\'s.\r\nThis Discipline open almost unlimited possibilities, as long as Bob sage advices are followed and that it is not abused.', 1, 'The Path of Blood, as its name indicate, is centered around blood.\n\nBob permet à Anastasia de tirer plus de puissance du sang, et de jouer avec ce sang, le sien ou celui des autres.\n\nAll uses of this Discipline gain a +2 bonus if the individual power is turned on a vampire with whom the user has a Blood Tie, in addition to any other modifier.\n\nIn addition, each power of this discipline suffer a malus equal to its level.', 1, 2, NULL, 'Control over blood'),
(12, 'Blood Gifts', 'The capacity gifted by the Benevolent Old Being are made to ease the Kindred rise in power and be devastating for anyone seeking to stop her.', 1, 'The **Gifts** are always active and require no rolls. The Kindred can always benefit from them, if she wish.\n\nOnce acquired, a **Gift** can never be forgotten, even if the prerequisite are no longer met. In this case, the Gift are preserved but cannot be used until the prerequisites are once again fulfilled.\n\nThe **Gifts** have the same price as a Clan\'s Discipline.', 1, NULL, NULL, 'Permanent powers'),
(13, 'Cachexy', 'Facility with this Discipline is considered the dividing line between what makes a Kindred a Mekhet with a peculiar feeding habit and a confirmed member of the Morbus bloodline. Any Kindred can choose to feed from diseased mortals if he’s willing to risk spreading infection to the rest of the herd, but only the Morbus can turn the effects of their feeding predilection into this formidable and dangerous Discipline.', 1, 'Cachexy allows the user to selectively spread, inflict or worsen the effects of any of the myriad diseases he carries at any given time. Some of the effects require the character to touch his intended target, while the dangerously high-level ones eliminate that impediment and render users walking biological hazards.\n\nWhen a Morbus intentionally spreads a disease with Cachexy, the player decides which of the diseases his character has sampled is inflicted. The specific disease isn’t important as far as rules are concerned, but the choice should have some sort of resounding effect on (or be driven by) the themes of your story. For the basic rules on diseases, see p. 176 of the **World of Darkness Rulebook**.', NULL, 2, 249, 'Selectively spread, inflict or worsen diseases'),
(14, 'Getsumei', 'The name of this Discipline comes from the Japanese phrase getsumei no michi, which translates roughly as “the moonlit path.” It comes from an apocryphal poetic exchange between two Tokugawa-era Burakumin who were master and student. Out of revenge for an undeserved slight, the bitter, ill-tempered student considered desecrating the body of a deceased son of an influential governor whose wealth had long supported a haughty Ventrue Prince. The Burakumin’s wise master replied only, “We can’t do as you say. The governor’s son is already picking plum blossoms along the moonlit path.” As the story goes, the shambling corpse of the son returned to the governor’s mansion late that evening to kill three of the governor’s concubines and four of his remaining children before being cut down by the mansion’s guards.', 1, 'As the exchange relates to the story, so does the name relate to the Discipline in the way its genteel seeming refers to something distasteful and ugly. This Discipline arises from the profession of handling and preparing the dead for burial, turning an already spiritually unclean undertaking into a perverse and ongoing desecration. With it, a Burakumin can learn secrets from the corpses of dead men, harvest parts of corpses as disgusting tools, and even imbue dead bodies with a false semblance of life.', NULL, 2, 250, 'Use dead bodies to activate powers');

As a rule, the more powerful the emotions, the more intense the colors, but even this guideline is betrayed by any number of mitigating factors, depending on circumstance. All the same, practice makes perfect; a true master aura-perceiver learns to understand the significance of each whorl and eddy.\r\n\r\nDue to the peculiar nature of such creatures’ auras, this power can be used as a means of detecting other supernatural entities. Vampire auras, for example, tend to be extremely pale, regardless of the colors. Werewolf auras are quite the contrary, nearly frantic in their intensity. Mage auras sparkle with power. Ghostly auras flicker like guttering candles.\r\n\r\nAn Auspex user who observes someone in the act of lying may recognize that the subject speaks falsely.

The Auspex user recognizes the lie if the most successes are rolled for him.\r\n\r\nApplied toward reading the mood of potential combatants, this power also grants its user a bonus to Initiative equal to the number of successes rolled in activating the effect. Doing so requires that the vampire speaks to or is in the proximity of intended combatants for at least one turn before a fight breaks out. That period of interaction allows the reading vampire to recognize that events are about to turn violent, so he can react with advanced knowledge.\r\n\r\n###### AURA SIGNIFIERS\r\n<table>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <th>Condition</th>\r\n    <th>Color</th>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Afraid</td>\r\n    <td>Orange</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Aggressive</td>\r\n    <td>Purple</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Angry</td>\r\n    <td>Bright Red</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Bitter</td>\r\n    <td>Brown</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Calm</td>\r\n    <td>Light Blue</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Compassionate</td>\r\n    <td>Pink</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Conservative</td>\r\n    <td>Lavender</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Depressed</td>\r\n    <td>Gray</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Desirous</td>\r\n    <td>Lustful Deep Red</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Distrustful</td>\r\n    <td>Light Green</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Envious</td>\r\n    <td>Dark Green</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Excited</td>\r\n    <td>Violet</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Generous</td>\r\n    <td>Rose</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Happy</td>\r\n    <td>Vermilion</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Hateful</td>\r\n    <td>Black</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Idealistic</td>\r\n    <td>Yellow</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Innocent</td>\r\n    <td>White</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Lovestruck</td>\r\n    <td>Bright Blue</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Obsessed</td>\r\n    <td>Bright Green</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Sad</td>\r\n    <td>Silver</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Spiritual</td>\r\n    <td>Gold</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Suspicious</td>\r\n    <td>Dark Blue</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Confused</td>\r\n    <td>Mottled, shifting colors</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Daydreaming</td>\r\n    <td>Sharp, flickering colors</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Diablerist</td>\r\n    <td>Black veins in aura</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Dominated</td>\r\n    <td>Controlled Weak, muted aura</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Frenzied</td>\r\n    <td>Rapidly rippling colors</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Psychotic</td>\r\n    <td>Hypnotic, swirling colors</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Vampire</td>\r\n    <td>Aura colors are pale</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Shapeshifter</td>\r\n    <td>Intensely vibrant aura</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Ghost</td>\r\n    <td>Splotchy, intermittent aura</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Magic</td>\r\n    <td>Use Myriad sparkles in aura</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>', 2, ''),

Most impressions (and therefore, most visuals stemming from them) pertain to the last person who handled the object in question, but two circumstances usually preclude such a reading. First, a long-time owner or handler of the object leaves stronger impressions than someone who handled it briefly, if more recently. Second, experiences associated with great emotion — be it hate, passion or fear —often linger in the form of intense psychic impressions on objects. It is these impressions that likely come to the fore over anything more recent or, in all likelihood, far less emotionally significant.\r\n\r\nAll that is required in order to glean information from an object by using this power is that the vampire turn the item over in his hands (or otherwise handle it) for a few moments, during which he enters a shallow trance.

They usually result in the character projecting successfully but being flung to an undesired destination (around the world or deep into an unknown place, for example).\r\n\r\nInteracting with the physical world or sprit world while using Twilight Projection is impossible. The character has no substance at all, not even spiritual substance — she is merely a projected consciousness. This state can be both a benefit and a drawback, in that the character is unimpeded by obstacles, but is also unable to affect any threats she encounters. It might come to pass that two vampires’ ghost bodies or a projected vampire and a genuine ghost encounter one another. They can communicate as if they were in the real world, but no sorts of physical or mystical exchanges can occur between them.\r\n\r\nA projected vampire’s psyche is invisible to most physical beings. A child or animal might intuitively sense the vampire’s presence, or even see him. Another Kindred using Heightened Senses or Aura Perception might spot the projected being by getting the most successes in a Wits + Investigation + Auspex (spotter) versus Resolve + Occult + Auspex (projector) contested roll. Both rolls are made reflexively.\r\n\r\nA projecting vampire’s other Disciplines do not work. Her spirit can certainly observe things, but its temporal connection to the body that serves as the conduit for the Kindred’s mystic curse is too tenuous for other mystical powers to manifest.\r\n\r\nWhile her consciousness roams, a vampire’s body lies in a torpor-like state on the spot where she left it. As long as her ghost body is active, the character remains ignorant of what goes on around her physical body. If the body is subjected to either torpor or Final Death, the projected psyche is pulled back immediately.\r\n\r\nA vampire’s body continues to expend Vitae nightly for the purposes of sustaining itself. The player must succeed on a standard Humanity roll for the ghost body to remain awake during the daytime. The consciousness of a vampire who falls asleep returns to her body and she rises the next night as normal, entirely within the physical world.\r\n\r\nA ghost body appears naked and with no possessions. Artifacts that are composed entirely of spirit matter might be employed in this form, but no physical objects transfer over. Likewise, any objects found during the wraithly endeavor cannot be manipulated or return with the character when she finally rejoins her physical body.\r\n\r\nA projecting vampire can potentially be barred mystically from returning to her body, or she might become lost and incapable of finding her body again. Rumors also speak of other spirits that can enter a vampire’s vacant body, stranding the Kindred as a ghost body. Denied her own body (or perhaps another one to possess), each night that passes for the ghost body removes a dot of Blood Potency from its essence. When those dots are reduced to zero, the ghost-Kindred suffers **Final Death** and fades into oblivion.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Suggested Modifiers**\r\n\r\nTypically, no modifiers are necessary, but the Storyteller may penalize the activation roll up to two dice in the event of a hastened projection, such as when a vampire abandons her body at the moment of Final Death (after all, a ghost body is better than no body at all).', 5, ''),

Celerity’s Initiative bonus is also added immediately in the turn, potentially moving the vampire’s action before her attacker’s in the Initiative roster.

If one Vitae is spent to keep Celerity active into the next turn, all of these benefits carry over.\r\n\r\nNote that Celerity is obviously superhuman in use. Few Princes smile upon uses of Celerity that leave too many curious mortal witnesses unaccounted for.\r\n\r\nCelerity cannot be invoked more than once per turn. That is, you may not spend a second Vitae and double the benefits of Celerity in a given turn, though you may spend Vitae across multiple turns to enjoy the benefits over those turns.\r\n\r\nIn turns when a character activates her Celerity, her dots in the Discipline are subtracted from any and all attacking characters’ dice pools, as the vampire moves much more quickly than normal and is harder to hit. This penalty to attackers’ pools applies in addition to any armor the Celerity-using character may have, as well as to Defense (though note, like armor, Celerity’s benefits do not diminish based on how many attacks the character faces). Celerity’s protection even applies against firearms.\r\n\r\nFor example, if a character has Celerity 3 and activates the Discipline, three dice are subtracted from any assailants’ dice pools.\r\n\r\nCelerity also adds to a character’s Initiative during the turnin which it is active. The aforementioned character with Celerity 3 and Initiative 5 would have a basic Initiative modifier of 8 during turns in which his Celerity is active.\r\n\r\nFinally, Celerity acts as a modifier to a character’s Speed while it is active.

Subjects of Command cannot be made to directly harm themselves, so an obviously suicidal order such as “Die!” is ineffective.\r\n\r\n“Sleep” and the like causes the subject to follow the order only if she does not believe herself to be in any mortal danger.

In such situations, the character merely falls senseless, but only for a turn.\r\n\r\nThe vampire may include the command word in a sentence, in order to conceal her use of the power from others. The command itself must be stressed, and the character must make eye contact precisely when that word is spoken.

All accumulated successes are lost and the subject continues to remember what happened.\r\n\r\n**Special:** Even a single success pacifies the victim for the length of time it takes to complete the process. Both vampire and subject must be safe and relatively composed when this power is used; it cannot be used to calm someone already in combat, for example.\r\n\r\nThe power, as with all uses of Dominate, requires eye contact. The Forgetful Mind does not allow for telepathic contact. Instead, the vampire acts much like a hypnotist, asking direct questions to draw answers from the subject, and then describing in detail any new memories she wishes to impose on the victim. Simple alterations, such as blurring brief and recent memories, are easy enough (and very effective for eliminating evidence of feeding or other Masquerade breaches). More comprehensive alterations, up to and including a complete reconstruction of the victim’s past and even identity, are possible albeit substantially more difficult.The victim’s subconscious struggles to resist false memories implanted from without, so the degree to which the vampire details new memories has direct bearing on how fully the subject assimilates them. An incomplete or simplistic false memory shatters much more swiftly and easily than does one with more attention to detail. For instance, “You drove home after work and had a very bad evening” is not likely to hold up. Far more effective would be an account such as:\r\n\r\n>“You left work late, due to a last-minute change ordered by the client. You still managed to get stuck in rush hour for an extra 25 minutes, and you were seriously frustrated by the time you pulled off the freeway. There weren’t even any good songs on the radio.\r\n>\r\n>Three blocks from home, a cop pulled you over for coasting through a stop sign. At least he only gave you a warning, but it was still just one more hassle.\r\n>\r\n>The frozen dinner you microwaved was awful, the TV movie starred some has-been you didn’t like, and the news was depressing.\r\n>\r\n>You finally turned off the TV in disgust and went to bed.”\r\n\r\nTruly effective use of The Forgetful Mind, then, requires substantial finesse and patience, as well as the ability to carefully and thoroughly think things through ahead of time. It’s fairly simple to sift through a victim’s memories and strip out recent events without even knowing precisely what happened, but doing so leaves a gap in the memory that can lead to further problems.\r\n\r\nMost people aren’t comfortable realizing they’ve lost a few hours or a night’s worth of memories, and they’re likely to try to find out what happened.Even new memories that the character imposes rarely have the same strength as the originals, and they can be broken or at least contradicted through investigation. For instance, a victim might not recall that she was attacked by a vampire, but she might remember being bitten, chalking it up to an animal attack or a spider. More vivid memories can return as snippets in dreams or be triggered by an unusual olfactory stimulus or spoken phrase. The process might take weeks or even years before the victim can begin to make sense of these flashes, but even the most effective memory manipulation is far from perfect — or truly permanent.\r\n\r\nA vampire may also use The Forgetful Mind to sense whether someone has had her memories altered in this fashion, and he can sometimes use his own power to draw forth and restore the original thoughts. No Kindred may use The Forgetful Mind to restore his own lost or altered memories, however.\r\n\r\nTo restore stolen or false memories, or to sense when memories have been altered, a character must possess Dominate at a level equal to or greater than that of the vampire who first tampered with the subject’s mind. If such is the case, the player then makes a contested roll in each stage of the extended action, to be compared against the initial user’s attempt, and must score more successes than the predecessor did.', 3, '');

(15, 'Conditioning', 4, 2, 24, '>Through constant veiled whispers, subtle hints and frequent sustained manipulation, a vampire can slowly render a particular victim substantially more suggestible. Conditioning is normally used only on favored or valuable servants and, over sufficient time, makes the character’s efforts to Dominate a subject far easier while making it harder for any other Kindred to do so. Acquiring such complete control over even the weakest mind is no easy task, however, and it normally takes weeks or even months to accomplish.\r\n\r\n**Rank:** ••••\\\r\n**Action:** Contested and Extended (6-15+ successes; each roll represents one week of mental manipulation); resistance is reflexive\\\r\n**Cost:** 1 Willpower per roll\\\r\n**Dice Pool:** Wits + Subterfuge + Dominate versus Resolve + Blood Potency\r\n\r\n**Roll Results**\\\r\n**Success:** The character wins a contested roll and makes progress in his efforts to suborn the subject’s will.\\\r\n**Exceptional Success:** The character wins a contested roll with five or more successes and makes substantial progress in his efforts to suborn the subject’s will.\\\r\n**Failure:** The character loses or ties a contested roll and the attempt fails.\\\r\n**Dramatic Failure:** All of the user’s successes to date are negated and the subject is immune to the character’s Dominate until the next sunset.\r\n\r\nWhile they are undeniably loyal, servants subject to Conditioning lose much of their ability to think for themselves, their own personalities blotted out by the will imposed on them. They follow their orders literally and to the letter, rarely showing any imagination or judgment, or taking the initiative to act on their own. Some Kindred have remarked that, after a sufficiently lengthy period of Conditioning, their servants actually resemble the walking dead more so than their masters.\r\n\r\nMortals, thralls, other vampires and other supernatural creatures are all subject to Conditioning, if it can be performed on them over the required period of time.\r\n\r\nConditioning does not have any mechanical effect until five more successes are accumulated in excess of the victim’s Willpower dots. (If the subject has Willpower 6, Conditioning begins to take effect once 11 successes are achieved.) Once this benchmark has been reached, all future attempts by the character to use any Dominate ability (including further uses of Conditioning) on the victim receive a +1 bonus, and all attempts by other Kindred to Dominate the subject suffer a -1 penalty. For every additional five successes that are accumulated, the bonus and penalty each increase by one, to a maximum of +5 and -5. The Storyteller, not the player, should keep track of the number of successes accumulated.\r\n\r\nOnce the character’s bonus reaches +3, he no longer needs to make eye contact with the Conditioning subject to use any Dominate abilities, though giving orders through artificial or impersonal means (such as by phone) imposes a -5 penalty to that particular attempt.\r\n\r\nSubjects of Conditioning are oblivious to the process being inflicted upon them unless they also possess the power.The Storyteller may allow a victim or someone close to him a Wits + Occult roll to recognize that something is wrong. If the roll fails, the process may continue unaffected. If the roll succeeds, an effort may be made to interrupt the process. If the Conditioning vampire is particularly careful about how suggestions and messages are conveyed, the Wits + Occult roll might suffer a -1 penalty. Interrupting the process could mean fleeing the vampire or restraining the subject from meeting the vampire before all the required successes are accumulated.\r\n\r\nIt is possible, albeit extremely difficult, to break a subject’s Conditioning after the required successes are gathered. If the victim is isolated from her master for a number of weeks equal to twice the master’s current Conditioning-granted bonus, the bonus drops by one. For example, a subject has been Conditioned for a long time, and her master has achieved a bonus of +4 to Dominate her. If she is kept completely isolated from her master for eight weeks, the bonus drops to +3. Six more weeks, and it drops to +2, and so forth. The subject’s own personality and creativity slowly reawakens during this period, though she still experiences periods of listlessness, depression and desperation. For at least the first few weeks, the subject most likely makes every attempt to return to her master. Until the subject is completely free, it is horrifyingly easy for the vampire to reassert his dominance,as he likely has at least some bonus to Dominate the individual for a long while.\r\n\r\nIf the subject of Conditioning is also the thrall of the vampire, all successes on a Conditioning roll are doubled. So, if a vampire seeks to Condition his own ghoul, and he gets three successes to her two in one roll to program the subject, he actually accumulates six successes in that Conditioning session.\r\n\r\nIf this power is turned on a vampire with whom the user has a blood tie, a +2 bonus applies.', 4, ''),

The mortal enters something of a fugue state while possessed, and he is aware of events only in a dreamlike, distorted fashion. The Kindred suffers the opposite effect. Her mind now resides within the victim, and her own body falls into a torpor-like state, becoming indistinguishable from a true corpse.

All previously accumulated successes are lost.\r\n\r\n**Special:** The vampire locks eyes with the victim and begins the process of utterly stripping away the subject’s Willpower.

The vampire may choose to end the possession and return to her body at any time, regardless of distance.\r\n\r\nThis occurs automatically if the vampire fails to remain awake.\r\n\r\nAny injuries inflicted on the subject also affect the vampire’s body.

Mystical attacks, however, still affect him normally, though mystical attacks that use mundane methods of delivery are similarly ineffective (such as claws or enchanted physical weapons).

In other words, once the character’s Resilience “powers down” at the end of the scene and the extra Health dots that the power confers are lost, he might have to contend with more serious wounds than initially harmed him unless he heals them while Resilience is still active. See the “Temporary Health Dots” sidebar on p. 173 of the **World of Darkness Rulebook** to see what happens when extra Health is lost.\r\n\r\nAlso, if a character suffers damage that upgrades her Health chart, Resilience does not downgrade it. For example, if a character with seven Health dots and a single dot of Resilience suffers nine points of lethal damage, that ninth point stays aggravated. The other eight points are recorded normally as lethal (seven for the Health dots plus one for the Resilience), but the ninth stays aggravated as it upgrades the leftmost box on the character’s Health chart. If that’s all the damage the character suffers by the end of the scene, another of those points of lethal damage upgrades to an aggravated wound once Resilience ceases and the character’s Health dots drop to seven again.

Six dice are rolled and three successes are achieved. The character leaps nine feet upward (2 Vigor + 1 foot, multiplied by the three successes rolled). Now say the character makes a running jump. The character crosses a base of 5 feet + another 6 (2+4) per success rolled. If he gets three successes, that’s 23 feet (6 more feet then he would have achieved without Vigor).', NULL, ''),

He has an effective armor trait of 1 against bashing attacks only.\n\n**Defensive Attack (•••):** Your character has mastered the ability to fight defensively. When using this maneuver, your character gains +2 to his Defense for the turn, but any attack he makes suffers a -2 penalty. He can move no more than his Speed while performing a Defense Attack maneuver in a turn.\n\n**Whirlwind Strike (••••):** Your character can unleash a storm of blows against an opponent. He can make a number of extra Brawl attacks for each point of Dexterity that he has above 2 in a single action. Each extra at-tack is made at a cumulative -1 modifier. Thus, he can perform a total of two attacks at Dexterity 3 (the second of which is at -1), three attacks at Dexterity 4 (the third of which is at -2), and four at Dexterity 5 (the fourth of which is at -3). All attacks must be on the same target.\n**Drawback:** Your character cannot use his Defense against any attack in the same turn in which he intends to use this maneuver. If he uses Defense against attacks that occur earlier in the Initiative roster, before he can perform this maneuver, he cannot perform the maneuver this turn. He is too busy bobbing and weaving out of the way of attacks.\n\n**Lethal Strike (•••••):** By focusing his might and concentration, your character can kill or maim an opponent with a well-placed strike. A strike inflicts lethal instead of bashing damage. \n**Drawback:** Spend one Willpower point per attack.

Each maneuver is a prerequisite for the next. So, your character can’t have “Deflect and Thrust” until he has “Whirling Blades.” The maneuvers and their effects are detailed below, all of which are based on the Weaponry Skill.\r\n\r\n**Whirling Blades (•):** Your character’s Dodge trait (Defense doubled; see p. 156) is not penalized by multiple attacks staged against him in a turn until the number of attacks exceeds his Weaponry dots, at which point each attack thereafter reduces his Dodge by -1. So, if your char- acter (with 2 Defense and 3 Weaponry) dodges attacks in a turn, the first three incoming attacks suffer his full Dodge trait as a penalty (-4). The fourth suffers a -3 penalty, the fifth suffers a -2 penalty, and so on. Basically, your character’s weapons move so quickly all about him that opponents in close combat have trouble reaching or assaulting him. The Brawling Dodge Merit (see p. 110) cannot replace normal Dodge (Defense doubled) when this maneuver is performed.\r\n\r\n**Deflect and Thrust (••):** Your character can avoid attacks and strike back in the same motion.

Each acquisition of this Merit is dedicated to one type of ally, whether in an organization, society or circle. Examples include the police, City Hall, criminals, unions, banks, university faculty and hospital staff. In order to have alliances in more than one venue, you need to purchase this Merit multiple times, each trait with its own dots.\n\nThus, your character might have Allies (Police) ••, Allies (Criminals) ••• and Allies (City Hall) •, each acquired separately at character creation or during play. Each dot that your character has indicates how deep his influence runs in that group. One dot might mean he can ask for minor favors, such as being spared a parking ticket if alliance is among police, or being allowed to see an article before it goes to press if alliance is among reporters. Three dots garner considerable favors, such as a building permit “going missing” at City Hall, or a strike resolution being wrapped up early among union leaders. Five dots allow for dangerous and even overtly criminal favors, such as a stock being sabotaged on Wall Street or the answers to an exam being shared by a university professor.\n\nThe kinds of requests made of people in an organization typically have to relate to their sphere of influence. Asking a criminal to slow down the bureaucratic process at City Hall makes no sense, but asking him to pass along word of a drug buy does. Favors might be minor and within the bounds of a person’s job or role, such as processing some paperwork more quickly than usual, or could be significant or dangerous and outside what’s allowed or even legal, such as allowing a civilian access to the police evidence locker.\n\nThe Storyteller has final say over what is an acceptable request and what is not. If there’s any doubt, the Storyteller could call for a Manipulation + Persuasion roll, with a bonus equal to your character’s Allies dots. Penalties might also apply based on the importance or danger of the request. Asking someone to do something already in the bounds of their role imposes no modifier, while asking them to do something that could get them suspended imposes a -3 penalty, and asking for something that could get them jailed or killed is -5. Frequent favors asked of the same group also imposes a penalty as group members grow tired of being called upon.\n\nSimilarly, a roll of Manipulation + Persuasion + Allies dots could determine how many police answer your character’s call for help, or how many longshoremen turn up when your character needs a show of force (one per success rolled).\n\nAllies doesn’t have to be defined in terms of specific individuals over whom your character has sway.

Contacts is strictly information-gathering. Contacts do not come perform services for your character or rush to his aid.

(42, 'Haven', 'social', 0, 1, 1, 5, 0, 0, NULL, 'A haven is a place where a vampire sleeps, protected from the sun during the deadly daylight hours. Legends tell of vampires in dark, twisted citadels on high mountain peaks, complete with labyrinthine catacombs, but the reality is far less grandiose. In truth, a haven can be as simple as a sewer or an abandoned warehouse or a crate in a forgotten storage closet, as long as it is undisturbed between dawn and dusk.\r\n\r\nAll havens are not created equal. A warehouse might have plenty of space and proximity to a significant amount of prey, but it might not be secure against unwanted visitors. An abandoned subway car in a long-forgotten tunnel has space and adequate security, but it might be so far out of the way that finding prey is difficult. Great time and effort is spent finding suitable havens, and their value is represented by three factors — location, size and security. Players who choose this Merit must also choose how to allocate these three factors when spending points. For instance, two points may be spent on Haven Location, with a third spent on Haven Security.\r\n\r\nA good Haven Location makes it easier for a vampire to feed, situated near a meeting place for large numbers of humans. A haven with many dots in this category might be close to several nightclubs or bars that do considerable nighttime business, while one with few dots might simply be close to a bus or train station that brings travelers on a regular basis. Each dot of Haven Location grants a +1 die bonus on hunting checks for the character who controls it and any whom she allows in. Havens without any dots in Location are sufficiently secluded so as to not provide any bonus. Haven Size is important to characters who need a place to safely store their possessions and valuables. A haven with no dots in Haven Size is just large enough for its owner and perhaps a single companion, with minimal if any storage capacity — the aforementioned crate in the forgotten storage closet, or a cramped apartment. By spending points to increase a haven’s size, a player allows for accoutrements and personal effects. Larger havens can be anything from mansions to mountain hideaways to vast subterranean catacombs. Note, however, that havens of considerable size are not necessarily easy to maintain.\r\n\r\n• A small apartment or underground chamber; 1-2 rooms\\\r\n•• A large apartment or small family home; 3-4 rooms\\\r\n••• A warehouse, church or large home; 5-8 rooms, or large enclosure\\\r\n•••• A abandoned mansion or network of subway tunnels; equivalent of 9-15 rooms or chambers\\\r\n••••• A sprawling estate or vast network of tunnels; countless rooms or chambers\\\r\n\r\nOf course, Haven Location and Haven Size do not prevent rival vampires from attempting to find and steal choice havens, nor do they prevent intrusion by mortals (police, criminal organizations, social workers). Players of characters who wish to ensure privacy and safety may choose to spend points on Haven Security, thus making it difficult for others to gain entrance. Havens with no dots in Haven Security can be found by those intent enough to look, and offer little protection once they have been breached. Each dot of Haven Security subtracts one die from efforts to intrude into the haven by anyone a character doesn’t specifically allow in. This increased difficulty may be because the entrance is so difficult to locate (behind a bookcase, under a carpet) or simply difficult to penetrate (behind a vault door). Also, each dot of Haven Security offers a +1 bonus on Initiative for those inside against anyone attempting to gain entrance (good sight lines, video surveillance).\r\n\r\nCharacters whose players spend no points at all on Haven might have their own small, humble havens, or perhaps they share the haven of a sire or Prince. In any event, they simply do not gain the mechanical benefits of those who have spent Merit points improving the quality of their homes. Each aspect of the Haven Merit has a limit of 5. In other words, Haven Location, Haven Size and Haven Security may not rise above 5 (to a maximum of 15 points spent on this Merit).\r\n\r\nSpecial: It’s possible for the Haven Merit to be shared among characters in a close-knit group. They might simply be devoted to one another and willing to pool what they have, or perhaps their mutual reliance on an individual or trust could bring them together to share what they have in common. To share this Merit, two or more characters simply have to be willing to pool their dots for greater capability. A shared rating in the Haven Merit cannot rise higher than five dots in any of the three aspects of the trait. That is, characters cannot pool more than five points to be devoted to, say, Haven Size. If they wish to devote extra points to the Merit, they must allocate those dots to a different aspect of the Merit, such as Location or Security.\r\n\r\nShared Haven dots can be lost. Coterie members or associates might be abused or mistreated, ending relationships. Group members might perform actions that cast themselves (and the group) in a bad light. Money might be spent or lost. If any group member does something to diminish the haven, its dots decrease for all group members. That’s the weakness of sharing dots in this Merit. The chain is only as strong as its weakest link. The Storyteller dictates when character actions or events in a story compromise shared Haven dots.\r\n\r\nCharacters can also leave a shared haven. A rift might form between close Kindred. A character might meet Final Death. Or one could be kicked out of the haven by the others. When a character leaves a shared-Haven relationship, the dots he contributed are removed from the pool. If the individual still survives, he doesn’t get all his dots back for his own purposes. He gets one less than he originally contributed. So, if a character breaks a relationship with his coterie, his two Haven dots are lost by the group, but he gets only one dot back for his own purposes. The lost dot represents the cost or bad image that comes from the breakup. If all members agree to part ways, they all lose one dot from what they originally contributed.\r\n\r\nThe Storyteller decides what reduced dots mean in the story when a character leaves a shared haven. Perhaps no one else picks up the character’s attention to Haven Security, leaving that to drop. The haven might not be tended as fastidiously, causing a drop in the Haven Location value. Maybe a portion of the haven falls into disuse or even collapses, causing an effective drop in Haven Size. Whatever the case, a plausible explanation must be determined.\r\n\r\nA character need not devote all of her Haven dots to the shared Haven Merit, of course. A Kindred might maintain a separate haven of her own outside the communal one represented by the shared trait. Any leftover dots that a character has (or is unwilling to share) signify what she has to draw upon as an individual, separate from her partners. For example, three characters share a haven and expend a group total of five dots. One character chooses to use two other dots on a private haven for herself. Those remaining two dots represent a haven entirely separate from what she and her partners have established together.\r\n\r\nTo record a shared Haven Merit on your character sheet, put an asterisk next to the name of the Haven Merit and fill in the total dots that your character has access to thanks to his partnership. In order to record his original contribution, write it in parentheses along with the Merit’s name. It is not important to note which aspect of the Haven Merit on which those points are spent, as this allows greater flexibility should a character ever decide to withdraw from the community arrangement.', 'Place secured from the sun', 'vampire', 2, 100, NULL),

(44, 'Status', 'social', 0, 1, 1, 5, 0, 0, NULL, 'While certain Merits detailed in the World of Darkness Rulebook focus on recognition in mortal society, certain Status concerns itself with the social orders of the night and represents recognition among other vampires. Status is divided into three areas — City, Clan and Covenant. Players must choose one of these three areas for each Merit point spent. (Enterprising Storytellers may come up with additional types of Status, and clever players might have unique applications as well. Status is designed as a sort of “umbrella” Merit, under which new types can be created.)\r\n\r\nCity Status represents a vested responsibility and according acknowledgement in the affairs of a domain. Regardless of clan and covenant, certain individuals rise to the top of the social or feudal strata, exemplary because of their efforts in the name of the domain as a whole. Princes, Regents, Primogen, Harpies and other “officers” of a given domain fit this description.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, City Status represents those Kindred who aren’t part of the prevailing social structure, but who nonetheless have significant esteem, sway or reputation among the Kindred. Examples include bosses of powerful gangs, Kindred who have considerable influence in specialized areas (prominent businessmen, city government, health care and hospitals, religious communities), or even just those who are powerful in their own right but largely apolitical, as with a potent elder who abstains from city responsibilities but whose territory is respected by all other local Kindred.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, City Status is very much a chicken-and-egg situation — does Prince Maxwell have City Status 5 because he’s Prince, or did his accumulated City Status result in his claiming praxis? In other cases, City Status obviously reflects accomplishment, as with a political activist who has many mortal supporters — but those supporters obviously didn’t join his cause because they knew he was a vampire. Harpies, in particular, make much of these distinctions, but some speculate that that’s because their own Status falls under the definition of City Status.\r\n\r\n• Hound or “rising star”\\\r\n•• Sheriff or “accomplished individual”\\\r\n••• Harpy, Seneschal, Master of Elysium or “much-deserved reputation”\\\r\n•••• Regent, Primogen, Herald or “cornerstone of Kindred society”\\\r\n••••• Prince or “true paragon”\r\n\r\nClan Status is concerned with lineage and the Blood. At the outset of a chronicle, a Kindred’s standing often reflects the prestige her sire has gained and passed along, such as with regard to the Ventrue. Many assume that childer who were Embraced by powerful and influential members of the clan have already shown some special quality or excellence, otherwise they would not have been chosen by so great a sire. This kind of recognition is short lived, however. A neonate might enjoy prestige by association under the purview of her sire, but such a favored childe is expected to make a name for herself.\r\n\r\nVampires who truly embody the ideals of their clan and who establish themselves in positions of power and influence (often as Prisci) gain the respect of others in their clan, being perceived as models for success. While the Daeva tell tales of particularly vicious Harpies of distant cities, the Gangrel speak of brooding hulks who confidently brave the Lupine-infested wilds alone. Those who diverge from the expected behavior of the clan in remarkable ways gain renown (or notoriety), as well, perhaps founding bloodlines that become known to vampire society as a whole.\r\n\r\nClan Status is not so rigidly defined as City Status. While individual clan titles might arise, the notion of esteem is more general in this context.\r\n\r\nCovenant Status represents rank, achievement and responsibility, less concerned with clan ideals and more with covenant actions, philosophies and accomplishments. The various covenants are not bound by any supernatural means or governed by clan lineage. They find a commonality of goals and ideologies, instead. It is not enough to be powerful or exemplary of clan ideals; a covenant is concerned with what its members have done to benefit its cause and combat its rivals.\r\n\r\nThose Kindred who enjoy the greatest covenant-based esteem are often the core members of their factions in a given city, those around whom others rally. These Kindred instigate or mediate conflict with other covenants, generally looking to further certain idealistic goals and establish themselves or other members in positions of influence in the local hierarchy. A Mekhet in command of a massive spy network might have status within his clan, but the lowliest of his spies might risk her unlife to gather a specific piece of information that helps oust the Invictus Prince, subsequently enjoying far more status with, say, the Ordo Dracul than her master.\r\n\r\nA character must have at least a single dot of Covenant Status in order to gain the benefits of any special abilities of that covenant. In other words, a character must have at least one dot of Covenant Status (Lancea Sanctum) in order to learn Theban Sorcery. Or a character must have at least one dot of Covenant Status (Invictus) to take advantage of the experience-point break on the Herd, Mentor, Resources and Retainer Merits. If a character leaves a covenant after learning some of its secrets, he does not lose any of those traits for which he paid experience points, but he may not learn additional dots of those traits (or additional dots at that particular price break, as with the Invictus and the Carthians). See p. 91-92 for the complete list of which covenants grant which benefits.\r\n\r\nLike Clan Status, Covenant Status is not so specifically tied to certain titles. It is more a notion of an individual’s accomplishments. A Lancea Sanctum Priest, for example, has a greater title than, say, a noted ethicist of the covenant, but that ethicist might have written numerous treatises on the state of undeath and the soul, according her more esteem among her peers than the Priest who rides solely on the weight of her title.\r\n\r\n• The character is known to a select subset of the clan/covenant — a spy network, perhaps.\r\n•• The majority of the clan/covenant in the city recognizes the character’s face and can recall her exploits.\r\n••• The character’s deeds are known to all in the local covenant, even in other nearby cities; many members of other covenants recognize her face.\r\n•••• Word of the character’s exploits has traveled far, and her name is known in cities around the country.\r\n••••• The character’s name and face are synonymous with her clan/covenant; her exploits are taught to new members of the clan/covenant.\r\n\r\nStatus can serve as a mixed blessing, however. Those who enjoy the most might be able to use it to their advantage, but they are also visible targets for their enemies. High levels of Status make it almost impossible to pass unnoticed, even while they open doors that would otherwise remain closed.\r\n\r\nStatus works like a “social tool” in that it adds to dice pools for social interactions between members of the sub-group in question. That is, Covenant Status adds to dice pools for interactions with members of the same covenant, Clan Status enhances interactions with members of the same Clan, and City Status affects those who are recognized residents of the given domain. City Status, however, may be ignored by those who are among the unbound.\r\n\r\n**Example:** Loki wants access to the Mekhet Priscus, but the Priscus is already occupied with an envoy from Clan Daeva. He instead finds himself dealing with one of her aides, another Mekhet. Loki, a Mekhet himself, tries to convince the aide that he has important business to discuss with the Priscus. His player adds Clan Status to a Manipulation + Persuasion dice pool. Loki has Manipulation 2, Persuasion 3 and Clan Status (Mekhet) 2, creating a pool of seven dice for the task.\r\n\r\nStatus does not add to dice pools predicated on supernatural powers. For example, a Prince’s City Status is not added to a dice pool for use of his Dread Gaze power. Dealing with Status can be a mire of responsibility, though clever characters can turn it to their advantage. They may actually have a variety of Status — it is not unheard of for a character to have City Status, Clan Status and Covenant Status. A character may have Clan Status only as a member of his own clan. For instance, a Nosferatu never gains Clan Status (Gangrel) no matter how much aid he provides the Savages. His aid of the Gangrel may certainly earn him esteem, but such concern is better handled on a case-by-case basis by the Storyteller, not in the form of Clan Status.\r\n\r\nCovenant Status is unique in that a character may, on occasion, have more than one form of it. This occurs almost exclusively at low levels, where a character is often beneath the notice of most other members of his covenants. A character may never have more than three dots total in Covenant Status among multiple covenants. A double-agent, for example, might take two dots worth of Covenant Status (Carthians) and a single dot of Covenant Status (Lancea Sanctum), representing the character’s true allegiance to the Carthians as well as the fact that he’s in on the ground floor of the Lancea Sanctum so that he can feed information back to his Carthian fellows. A character may even have a single dot of Covenant Status in three different covenants — perhaps he’s somewhat accomplished in each, but has yet to determine where his true loyalties lie. Naturally, a character with Status in only one Covenant is not beholden to the three-dot limit.\r\n\r\nA character with dots in Covenant Status through multiple factions does indeed gain access to those covenants’ special benefits. Covenants expect certain contributions of their members, however, and if other Kindred find out that the vampire in question plays multiple sides against the middle, he might see that Status vanish in a single night in which he’s called upon to account for his treacheries. Such is also the reason that cumulative Covenant Status is limited to three dots. By the time a character gains a certain degree of Status in a single covenant, he sticks out like a sore thumb if he turns up among another covenant’s members. (An exception to this might occur if a character is truly some sort of deep-cover agent or other mole, but that circumstance is best handled at the Storyteller’s discretion).', 'Status for Kindred society', 'vampire', 2, 102, NULL),

Each maneuver is a prerequisite for the subsequent maneuver. So, your character cannot have “Feint” until he has “Thrust.” These maneuvers and their effects are described below. All maneuvers are based upon the Weaponry Skill.\n\nFencing is meant to be performed with specific swords. The maneuvers below can be used without penalty provided your character is using one of the following swords: curved sword, fencing sword, rapier or sword cane. Any other type of sword incurs a –1 penalty against any of the maneuvers listed below. (For more information on swords as melee weapons, see Chapter One.)\n\n**Thrust (•):** The thrust is a simple yet powerful attack. A fencer’s stance (one leg anchoring your character’s position and the other leg lunging him forward) gives this attack extra force. When your character makes a thrust attack, plunging the blade toward an opponent, he does so with a +1 bonus.\n\n**Feint (••):** Your character knows how to make a fake attack intended to throw off an opponent. Make a “normal” attack roll (Strength + Weaponry), and this roll is penalized by the opponent’s Defense, par usual. This attack is fake; it does not strike the foe or do any damage. If your character achieves even a single success, however, the opponent is momentarily confused and off-balance, and may not apply her Defense against the next attack she suffers (which may be from your character the following turn or may be from some other source beforehand).\n\n**Riposte (•••):** A Riposte requires an attack to be made against your character. He steps out of the way of the attack using his Dodge (i.e., her Defense, doubled). While his opponent is open, he can then make a sudden and quick attack, which is performed at a –1 penalty. However, the opponent’s Defense does not further penalize the attack roll. **Drawback:** To perform this maneuver, the character must spend a Willpower point, which must be spent as soon as she decides to apply twice her Defense to an incoming enemy attack.If the character suffers any further attacks on a turn where she has used Riposte, she cannot apply her Defense against them.\n\n**Moulinet (••••):** If your character makes a successful hit on an adversary with his sword, he may then rotate his wrist and perform a quick spiral cut with the tip of the weapon. This additional cut requires no additional roll; the cut does lethal damage to the opponent equal to your character’s Dexterity. **Drawback:** To perform this maneuver, the character must spend a Willpower point before she makes her initial attack roll.

Each maneuver is a prerequisite for the subsequent maneuver. So, your character cannot have “Disarm” until he has “Lock and Block.” These maneuvers and their effects are described below. All maneuvers are based upon the Weaponry Skill.\r\n\r\nNote that to perform these maneuvers, a character must have at least one blunt weapon in hand. This weapon is potentially one escrima stick (or a pair), but it can be any blunt object shorter than two feet in length. If the character wields two weapons, he still assumes the –2 penalty for off-hand attacks. Once the character reaches the fourth and final level of this style, he can then choose to use any of the maneuvers *without* weapons. At this stage he learns the “empty hand” techniques of escrima.\r\n\r\n**Lock and Block (•):** With this move, your character uses an adversary’s momentum against her. If you succeed on a Strength + Weaponry roll, your character captures an opponent’s attacking arm in his own and gains a grapple over her (for grappling rules, see p. 157, **the World of Darkness Rulebook**). You may add your character’s Defense to the Strength + Weaponry roll, as he is technically making a defensive maneuver. However, if you choose to add his Defense to this attack, you may not apply his Defense against any incoming attacks that turn. If he has already applied his Defense, he may still utilize this maneuver, but he does not get to add his Defense to the roll.\r\n\r\n**Disarm (••):** This allows your character to capture an incoming attack and bring his own weapon down upon a foe’s forearm, potentially forcing the enemy to drop her weapon. (Note that this is different than the Disarm Merit.) To enact this maneuver, make a normal attack roll (Dexterity + Weaponry). Compare the successes on this roll against the opponent’s Stamina. If the successes are equal to or exceed her Stamina score, she drops the weapon. This attack does cause damage to the opponent, as well. Take the successes gained on the attack roll and halve them (round up).

This attack can take any form: thrusting a baton into a solar plexus, hitting a foe’s temple or the bridge of her nose or using a stick’s momentum to push her into an awkward position. The attack is made at a –2 penalty. If successful, the attack does full damage and the opponent’s next attack is made at a –3 penalty.\r\n\r\n**Many-Handed Defense (••••):** Escrima practitioners know how to move and flow with the combat in ways often unparalleled in other weapon-style systems.

All of the following maneuvers work only with rifles (including assault rifles).\r\n\r\n**On Scope (•):** Your character has an intuitive understanding of long-range ballistics and has spent countless hours straining to pick out tiny details through a telescopic sight. The maximum bonus she may receive from aiming (see **the World of Darkness Rulebook**, p. 162) is increased to her Composure +1 for semi-automatic and automatic rifles and her Composure +2 for break-action, bolt-action and lever-action rifles. In addition, when using a scope or other long-range optic device (e.g., binoculars), she receives a +2 bonus to all perception rolls (see **the World of Darkness Rulebook**, p. 45).\r\n\r\n**Battlesight Zero (••):** Once your character is familiar with the capabilities of a rifle, she can wring unparalleled performance from it. Whenever your character sights in a rifle (see “Sighting Tools,” p. 164), she doubles the number of attacks that receive the bonus from this process. In addition, whenever she makes an attack with a rifle that receives this bonus, the weapon’s short range is increased by five yards times her Wits, medium range by twice this amount and long range by three times this amount.\r\n\r\n**Focused Shot (•••):** Your character can lurk motionless in ambush for days, ignoring sleep deprivation, temperature extremes and even life-threatening injuries in the name of putting lead on target. When making an aimed shot, she may ignore an amount of penalties for wounds, drugs, disease, pain, fatigue, environmental conditions and similar factors equal to her Resolve. For example, if your character has Resolve 4, has two points of Health remaining (–2), has gone without sleep for 36 hours (–2) and has ingested strong hallucinogens (–3), her aimed shots suffer only a –3 penalty instead of the –7 that affects all her other dice pools.\r\n\r\n**Tactical Intervention (••••):** Split-second timing and nerves of steel enable your character to take advantage of the smallest opportunities for accurate shot placement. When making an aimed shot, all penalties for shooting into close combat and for concealment are halved, rounding down.\r\n\r\n**One Shot, One Kill (•••••):** When your character picks up her rifle, people fall down. It’s just that simple. When making an aimed shot, do not add the rifle’s Damage rating to the attack dice pool (though “9 again” or “8 again” still applies if it would normally). Instead, if the attack succeeds, add the rifle’s Damage rating as extra successes. **Drawback:** Spend one Willpower per attack.

While normally such attacks confer no bonuses, the character is aware how to deceive an opponent into mounting a Defense against an attack that isn’t coming — and then stage an attack from a different angle. The foe’s Defense is at –1 during such an attack. **Drawback:** This maneuver can only be made every other turn.\r\n\r\n**Vital Attack (•••):** Your character knows how to target his attacks to vital organs and other vulnerabilities.

All maneuvers are based upon the Weaponry Skill.\n\nNote that while a quarter-, bo or jo staff are the norm for this fighting style, the maneuvers are not limited to these weapons. A character can use any polearm for these maneuvers, but using other polearms with an item that isn’t one of the aforementioned three staff types requires an additional point of Weaponry (Weaponry •••). A character can also utilize improvised polearms (including post-hole diggers, scythes or other objects at least five feet in length) with this maneuvers. In such cases, the Weaponry ••• is still required, and all attack rolls are made with the appropriate improvised weapon penalties in place. Remember as well that utilizing a polearm in combat grants the wielder a +1 Defense.\n\n**Trip (•):** Your character can use her polearm to trip a single opponent, hopefully sending him to the ground. It is a contested roll pitting the character’s normal attack roll against the opponent’s Dexterity + Athletics. The character’s attack is penalized by the foe’s Defense, as usual. If the opponent falls, assume Knockdown rules (per p. 168, the **World of Darkness Rulebook**). In this case, however, the fall to the ground incurs a single point of bashing damage to the opponent.\n\n**Temple Strike (••):** Your character brings her staff against the side of her adversary’s head. The normal –3 penalty to hit the head still applies, but if the damage meets or exceeds the target’s Size, the target falls unconscious for a number of turns equal to the damage done. This damage is usually bashing, as it is meant to be performed with a blunt staff. The damage can be performed with a bladed weapon such as the naginata, however. The effect is the same, but the damage is now lethal instead of bashing.\n\n**Dangerous Radius (•••):** With this technique, your character can swing her weapon in a wide arc, hitting anyone within three yards. Make a normal attack roll for the character (Strength + Weaponry + weapon bonuses). This roll receives a dice penalty equal to the number of opponents hit with this strike (to a maximum of –5 dice). Successes achieved on this roll are done as damage to all within the three-yard radius. If the weapon is a normal blunt polearm (i.e., a staff), it does bashing. If bladed, the weapon causes lethal damage. **Drawback:** To perform this maneuver, the character must spend a Willpower point before she makes her initial attack roll.

Your character can rely on her regnant to provide information, extra Vitae, equipment or even to personally intervene on her behalf. Conversations with your character’s regnant might be genuine interpersonal dialogue rather than the simple dispensation of orders, and you might even find him turning to your character for true companionship. This doesn’t suggest that the ghoul is anything remotely like an equal to her regnant, just that she isn’t necessarily made to feel like a lowly, servile nonentity.\n\nThere are a variety of beneficial relationships with regnants. One ghoul might enjoy service to a generous master who isn’t significantly influential, while another is sheltered by her regnant’s status without receiving any special attention from him. **The advantages of this Merit are split into three factors — power, favor and trust**. Players who choose this Merit must also choose how to allocate these three factors when spending points. For instance, the first dot might go toward Regnant Power with two more going toward Regnant Favor. Each one of these characteristics has a limit of five dots, and the fifth dot costs two dots to purchase.\n\nA ghoul with a powerful regnant finds that her dealings with local Kindred and their ghouls are, while not simple, at least a bit easier. Her compatriots (and regnant’s compatriots) know who she serves, and probably won’t be eager to impede her, especially if the news of such interference reaches her regnant’s ears. A regnant represented by several dots in **Power** might hold a significant position in the city (such as a respected Primogen, Priscus or Prince), while one represented by just a couple could be an acknowledged member of a powerful covenant. **Each dot of Regnant Power confers a +1 die bonus on Persuasion, Intimidation and Socialize rolls when in conflict with a local ghoul or Kindred**. Regnants whose ghouls have no dots allocated thus are local bottom-feeders.\n\nNote that Regnant Power need not be a simple reflection of title or position. A Priscus regnant might actually earn very little respect from the local Kindred, while an unaligned vampire without ties to the local vampire community might be so old and dangerous as to be feared by all.\n\n**Regnant Favor** reflects the master’s willingness to provide her ghoul access to Vitae, resources and equipment. It doesn’t necessarily reflect an emotional bond between the regnant and ghoul as much as it does a measure of generosity. **Each dot of Regnant Favor could reflect an additional hit of Vitae (one at a time) that a ghoul may request from her regnant per month without risking his wrath**. Alternatively, **Regnant Favor could be used in place of Resources to determine whether a ghoul can afford to secure equipment**. A ghoul with three dots in Regnant Favor could requisition a heavy pistol from his regnant, while one with five dots could take one of his regnant’s sports cars from the vast warehouse-like garage. Regnants without any dots allocated to this category are typically tight-fisted with their resources (and Vitae) and not likely to give any gifts without some real convincing.\n\n**Regnant Trust** is a measure of the extraordinary quality of the relationship your character enjoys with her regnant. Some ghouls are simply well liked by their regnants and are more likely to be afforded some breathing room with respect to their performance. The Kindred knows that his trusted ghoul will perform whatever job has been set before her, so he’s willing to let some minor early setback slide. An especially trusting regnant might even gift his ghoul with tidbits of forbidden information, which might prove infinitely more valuable than a gun or a car. **Each dot of Regnant Trust confers a +1 die bonus on Persuasion rolls in dealings between your character and her regnant**. Regnants who are represented by having no dots allocated to this category don’t necessarily dislike their ghouls, they just fail to see any reason to be friendly with them.\n\nNote that ghoul characters may not share the Regnant Merit.

All purified are assumed to have a single legal identity and need pay no Merit dots for this privilege. However, if the purified has lived in a single legal identity for more than two decades, your character has almost certainly begun to have to use various minor forms of disguise to change his appearance so that it better matches his legal age.\n\nHaving a second identity allows purified to have an identity that matches his apparent age and it also allows him to easily vanish if any legal questions arise surrounding his activities. In addition, if your character’s body dies in such a way that others notice his death, he can use this alternate identity if there is no way for him to explain his perceived death. However, modern background checks, paper trails and bureaucratic scrutiny make acquiring a new identity far more difficult than it was in the past. Few characters have the skills to create a new identity for themselves. The vast majority must look for help, either from older and more experienced purified or from some mortal or supernatural source who is skilled in the various complex and highly illegal methods of acquiring such documents.\n\nThe number of dots spent on this Merit determines how convincing and in-depth the documentation surrounding this new life actually is. Alternate Identity (●) represents an identity that passes casual inspection, but not much else — a character can go shopping and get around in most daily situations, but any kind of trained scrutiny such as from a police officer or bureaucrat immediately identifies this identity as a fake. Alternate Identity (●●) creates an identity that will pass most forms of relatively cursory professional inspection, but cannot stand up to a sustained investigation. A police officer that pulls your character over will not automatically pick up anything unusual if she runs the character’s license plates or calls up his name in a database. However, if your character is arrested and the police begin a formal investigation his identity will quickly unravel. Alternate Identity (●●●●) represents an identity that is essentially as real as any identity can be — it takes a truly dedicated, competent and time-consuming search by trained professionals to uncover any hint that the purified isn’t exactly who he claims to be, at least as far as his documentation is concerned. This Merit may be purchased multiple times at multiple ratings, each time representing a different identity. Also, an identity may also be upgraded later with the appropriate in-game explanation and experience expenditure. In the case of certain Merits such as Resources or Status, it might also be worth noting to which identity these Merits are tied, since a character may not easily be able to access or maintain them if that identity is compromised.\n\n**Drawback:** Although one-dot Alternate Identities require no maintenance, both of the more thorough versions do. If someone checks on a legal identity, they will immediately become suspicious if the person has no legal address or magazine subscriptions, pays no taxes and has no phone number. Similarly, if all of this data exactly matches your character’s primary legal identity, many people soon realize both of these identities belong to the same individual. Therefore, your character must take time and spend money to maintain any two or four-dot Alternate Identities. Having the identity make frequent trips to remote locations and similar inventive dodges can reduce the frequency of this maintenance. The amount of maintenance needed to keep a two-dot identity looking legitimate is fairly minimal, requiring only a few hours of work every month. However, keeping a four-dot identity believable requires at least several hours of work every week. Failure to perform this upkeep on an identity causes it to be reduced to the next lowest level.

Each maneuver is a prerequisite for the next. So, your character can’t have “Duck and Weave” until he has “Body Blow.” The maneuvers and their effects are described below, most of which are based on the Brawl Skill.\r\n\r\n**Body Blow (•):** Your character can deliver powerful blows that leave opponents reeling and gasping for air. If successes inflicted in a single Brawl attack equal or exceed a target’s Size, the victim loses his next action.\r\n\r\n**Duck and Weave (••):** Your character is trained to instinctively duck and evade an opponent’s blows. Use the higher of your character’s Dexterity or Wits to determine his Defense when dealing with Brawl-based attacks only (not against Weaponry attacks). If a combination of Brawl- and Weaponry-based attacks is focused on your character in the same turn, use his normal Defense against both.\r\n\r\n**Combination Blows (•••):** Your character’s training and experience allow him to devastate opponents with a flurry of rapid blows. He can make two Brawl attacks against the same target in a single action. The second attack suffers a -1 penalty. \r\n**Drawback:** Your character cannot use his Defense against any attack in the same turn in which he intends to use this maneuver. If he uses Defense against attacks that occur earlier in the Initiative roster, before he can perform this maneuver, he cannot perform the maneuver in the turn. He is too busy bobbing and weaving out of the way of attacks.\r\n\r\n**Haymaker (••••):** Your character can deliver powerful, accurate blows capable of knocking an opponent unconscious with a single punch. A single Brawl attack that equals or exceeds the target’s Size in damage might knock him unconscious. A Stamina roll is made for the victim. If it succeeds, he is conscious but he still loses his next action due to the Body Blow (see above). If it fails, he is unconscious for a number of turns equal to the damage done. \r\n**Drawback:** Your character cannot use his Defense against any attack in the same turn in which he intends to use this maneuver. If he uses Defense against attacks that occur earlier in the Initiative roster, before he can perform this maneuver, he cannot perform the maneuver in the turn. He is too busy bobbing and weaving out of the way of attacks.\r\n\r\n**Brutal Blow (•••••):** Your character’s accuracy and power are such that his fists are lethal weapons, able to injure or kill opponents. A brutal blow inflicts lethal instead of bashing damage. \r\n**Drawback:** Spend one Willpower point per attack. Note that this Willpower expenditure does not add three dice to the attack.'),

So, your character can’t have “Iron Skin” until he has “Focused Attack.” The maneuvers and their effects are listed below, most of which are based on the Brawl Skill.\r\n\r\n**Focused Attack (•):** Physical conditioning and accuracy allow your character to deliver blows at vulnerable spots on targets. Penalties to hit specific targets are reduced by one. See “Specified Targets,” p. 165. Even when a specific part of an opponent is not targeted, armor penalties to your character’s Brawl attacks are reduced by one.\r\n\r\n**Iron Skin (••):** Your character has hardened his body to physical blows, allowing him to withstand repeated hits with minimal effect. He has an effective armor trait of 1 against bashing attacks only.\r\n\r\n**Defensive Attack (•••):** Your character has mastered the ability to fight defensively. When using this maneuver, your character gains +2 to his Defense for the turn, but any attack he makes suffers a -2 penalty. He can move no more than his Speed while performing a Defense Attack maneuver in a turn.\r\n\r\n**Whirlwind Strike (••••):** Your character can unleash a storm of blows against an opponent. He can make a number of extra Brawl attacks for each point of Dexterity that he has above 2 in a single action. Each extra at-tack is made at a cumulative -1 modifier. Thus, he can perform a total of two attacks at Dexterity 3 (the second of which is at -1), three attacks at Dexterity 4 (the third of which is at -2), and four at Dexterity 5 (the fourth of which is at -3).

So, your character can’t have “Deflect and Thrust” until he has “Whirling Blades.” The maneuvers and their effects are detailed below, all of which are based on the Weaponry Skill.\r\n\r\n**Whirling Blades (•):** Your character’s Dodge trait (Defense doubled; see p. 156) is not penalized by multiple attacks staged against him in a turn until the number of attacks exceeds his Weaponry dots, at which point each attack thereafter reduces his Dodge by -1. So, if your char- acter (with 2 Defense and 3 Weaponry) dodges attacks in a turn, the first three incoming attacks suffer his full Dodge trait as a penalty (-4).

Characters don’t need this Skill simply to drive a car. It’s safe to assume in a modern society that most individuals are familiar with automobiles and the rules of the road. Rather, this trait covers the training or experience necessary to operate at high speeds, to tackle hazardous road conditions and to push a vehicle to the limits of its performance. Drive is the difference between a typical suburban parent with a minivan and a police officer, car thief or racecar driver. (See “Handling” on p. 146 for dice-pool equipment modifiers for various vehicles.) The Skill also applies to piloting and controlling boats; your character’s Drive dots are applied equally to handling boats. In order for your character to be able to pilot a plane, he needs a Pilot Specialty in the Skill. With that, efforts to control a plane call for a Drive-based roll, plus one die for your character’s Pilot Specialty. A character with the Drive Skill who does not possess a Pilot Specialty cannot effectively operate a plane.

If traveling at high speed, a crash occurs, wrecking the vehicle and likely injuring its occupants. If the local terrain presents no convenient obstacles (your character drives on an open a highway or salt flat), the car flips and rolls for some distance until it comes to a stop. If traveling at low speed, the vehicle sideswipes a parked car or tree, or possibly slides off the road and becomes stuck at the Storyteller’s discretion. See “Vehicles”, p. 141, for rules on how to handle vehicles and crashes.\\\r\n**Failure:** Your character doesn’t complete his intended maneuver. The direction the vehicle travels (if it goes anywhere at all) is determined by the Storyteller rather than by your character.\\\r\n**Success:** Your character completes his intended maneuver.\\\r\n**Exceptional Success:** Not only does your character complete his intended maneuver, he gains much more ground than expected.

This Skill covers both the written and spoken word and other forms of entertainment, from journalism to poetry, creative writing to acting, music to dance. Characters can use it to compose written works or to put the right words together at the spur of the moment to deliver a rousing speech or a memorable toast. Used well, Expression can sway others’ opinions or even hold an audience captive.\r\nWhen composing a poem or writing a novel, roll Wits or Intelligence (depending on whether the work is poetic or factual) + Expression. When reciting to an audience, roll Presence + Expression. Playing an instrument involves Intelligence + Expression for a known piece, and Wits + Expression for an improvised one. Dance calls for Dexterity + Expression.\r\n\r\n**Possessed by:** Actors, ballet dancers, journalists, musicians, poets, rock stars, writers\r\n\r\n**Specialties:** Classical Dance, Drama, Exposés, Musical Instrument, Newspaper Articles, Speeches\r\n\r\n#### Roll Results\r\n**Dramatic Failure:** Your character’s performance is muddled and confusing. It not only fails to communicate his ideas, but it’s unbearable. If she’s lucky, the fiasco is forgotten quickly. If not, she is the butt of critics’ jokes for some time to come.\\\r\n**Failure:** Your character’s performance fails to capture the audience’s interest or attention.\\\r\n**Success:** Your character’s performance gets its point across in the manner intended, capturing the audience’s interest.\\\r\n**Exceptional Success:** The performance enthralls the audience to the extent that members can think of (or notice) nothing else.\r\n\r\n**Suggested Equipment:** Haute couture (+1), quality musical instrument (+2), supreme-quality musical instrument — a Stradivarius violin (+4 or +5) Possible Penalties: Unfamiliar audience (-1 to -3), poorly made instrument (-1), foreign audience (-1), irritated audience (-3)', 'expression');

They might be considered paranoid or just consumed by a self-loathing that they project onto others.\r\n\r\nYour character regains one Willpower point whenever she gains something important from a rival or has a hand in harming that rival’s wellbeing.\r\n\r\n**Example:** *Hughes watched the reporters, sponsors and women flock to Montgomery like moths to a flame.

(2, 'Gluttony', 'Gluttony is about indulging appetites to the exclusion of everything else. It’s about dedicating oneself to sensual pleasures or chasing the next high. A glutton makes any sacrifice to feed his insatiable appetite for pleasure, regardless of the cost to himself or those around him. He might be considered a junky or even a kleptomaniac (he steals things he doesn’t need just for the thrill of it).\r\n\r\nYour character regains one spent Willpower point whenever he indulges in his addiction or appetites at some risk to himself or a loved one.\r\n\r\n**Example:** *They’d come for his dad. They’d hauled his ass into the bedroom, brought in the power tools, and then the screaming started. James thought about protesting, but what good would it do? He decided to drown it all out, instead. He snorted some coke and tipped back the whiskey. Sure, he’d gotten involved with them, and maybe that was a mistake, but he told his dad to keep out of it. James took another drink. The whiskey trailed fire down his throat and dulled his senses. They didn’t tolerate people interfering in their business.

They want more — more money, a bigger house, more status or influence — no matter that they may already have more than they can possibly handle. Everything is taken to excess. To the greedy, there is no such thing as having too much. If that means snatching someone else’s hard-earned reward just to feather one’s own nest, well, that’s the way it goes.\r\n\r\nYour character regains one Willpower point whenever he acquires something at the expense of another. Gaining it must come at some potential risk (of assault, arrest or simple loss of peer respect).\r\n\r\n**Example:** *Gregor scanned down the list of names. It read like a small-town telephone book.

(4, 'Lust', 'The Vice of Lust is the sin of uncontrolled desire. A lusty individual is driven by a passion for something (usually sex, but it can be a craving for virtually any experience or activity) that he acts upon without consideration for the needs or feelings of others. A lusty individual uses any means at his disposal to indulge his desires, from deception to manipulation to acts of violence.\r\n\r\nYour character is consumed by a passion for something. He regains one Willpower point whenever he satisfies his lust or compulsion in a way that victimizes others.\r\n\r\n**Example:** *For two weeks, Aaron had been holed up with the star witness, “protecting” her. That she was also suspected as an accomplice in the crime hadn’t stopped Aaron from banging her seven ways to Sunday, ever since she’d come on to him on the second day. It might have meant compromising the witness and his career, but this chick was worth it. Aaron didn’t care that her last four husbands had died or that the precinct had labeled her “Black Widow.” The sex just kept getting better. In fact, he was exhausted for hours afterward. If he’d stopped to think about it, the blackouts might have worried him, but he didn’t want to think about it.*\r\n\r\n*By using his position and influence to get sexual favors, Aaron indulges in his defining Vice and regains a point of spent Willpower.*\r\n\r\n**Other Names:** Lasciviousness, impatience, impetuousness \r\n\r\n**Possessed by:** Movie producers, politicians, rock stars\r\n'),
(5, 'Pride', 'Pride is the Vice of self-confidence run amok. It is the belief that one’s every action is inherently right, even when it should be obvious that it is anything but. A prideful person refuses to back down when his decision or reputation is called into question, even when the evidence is clear that he is in the wrong. His ego does not accept any outcome that suggests fallibility, and he is willing to see others suffer rather than admit that he’s wrong.\r\n\r\nYour character regains one Willpower point whenever he exerts his own wants (not needs) over others at some potential risk to himself. This is most commonly the desire for adulation, but it could be the desire to make others do as he commands.\r\n\r\n**Example:** *Fabrice stepped out of his car and faced the old mansion. Four centuries of French weather had taken its toll on the once regal place. The setting sun stretched shadows across the façade, highlighting every flaw and crack, and throwing a distorted shadow over the front door like an evil omen.*\r\n\r\nHaunted indeed. \r\n\r\n*When the unkempt, ill-mannered student had shown up to his lecture and publicly challenged the professor to spend one night in the mansion, how could the foremost debunker of mystic nonsense decline?*\r\n\r\n*Fabrice was sure he had more to fear from the house collapsing than from evil spirits. Yes, he was quite sure.*\r\n\r\n*By refusing to back down to the challenge, and reveling in his own self-assurance, Fabrice indulges his defining Vice and regains a point of spent Willpower.*\r\n\r\n**Other Names:** Arrogance, ego complex, vanity\r\n**Possessed by:** Corporate executives, movie stars, street thugs\r\n'),
(6, 'Sloth', 'The Vice of Sloth is about avoiding work until someone else has to step in to get the job done. Rather than put in the effort — and possibly risk failure — in a difficult situation, the slothful person simply refuses to do anything, knowing that someone else will step in and fix the problem sooner or later. The fact that people might needlessly suffer while the slothful person sits on his thumbs doesn’t matter one bit.\r\n\r\nYour character regains one Willpower point whenever he successfully avoids a difficult task but achieves the same goal nonetheless.\r\n\r\n**Example:** *Catherine pretended to listen as the fourth tenant that day called to tell her, the superintendent, that the security lights were out. Some asshole had gone and broken all the lights around the apartment building.*\r\n\r\n*Sure, she’d heard stories about the Harcourt building, where the lights were shattered one night and there were break-ins the next. Depending on who was telling the story, some weird shit happened over there.*\r\n\r\n*But the afternoon soaps were starting, and Catherine decided the Harcourt stuff was just rumors. Besides, she had a baseball bat in case any boogey men came calling. She unplugged the phone and let her ass warm the couch. The lights could wait another day.*\r\n\r\n*By avoiding work despite the repercussions, Catherine indulges her defining Vice and regains a point of spent Willpower.*\r\n\r\n**Other Names:** Apathy, cowardice, ignorance\r\n \r\n**Possessed by:** Couch potatoes, trust-fund heirs, welfare cheats'),
(7, 'Wrath', 'The Vice of Wrath is the sin of uncontrolled anger. The wrathful look for ways to vent their anger and frustration on people or objects at the slightest provocation. In most cases the reaction is far out of proportion to the perceived slight. A wrathful person cut off on the freeway might try to force another driver off the road, or a wrathful cop might delight in beating each and every person he arrests, regardless of the offense.\r\n\r\nYour character regains one spent Willpower point whenever he unleashes his anger in a situation where doing so is dangerous. If the fight has already begun, no Willpower points are regained. It must take place in a situation where anger is unwarranted or inappropriate.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Example:** *As April staggered in, Rebecca surprised her at the door, demanding the month’s rent. April had gotten hooked on the new drug that had hit the streets. She had spent most of her time day-tripping and having paranoia attacks about “things eating through the walls of the world.” Rebecca didn’t care anymore, and when the usual litany of excuses began, Rebecca hit her. Blood ran from April’s nose and down her mouth.*\r\n\r\n*“I want... the damn... rent,” Rebecca yelled, punctuating each statement with another blow until April was on the ground, balled up and crying.* \r\n\r\n*By beating the money out of April, Rebecca indulges her defining Vice and regains a point of spent Willpower.*\r\n\r\n**Other Names:** Antisocial tendencies, hot-headedness, poor anger management, sadism\r\n\r\n**Possessed by:** Bullies, drill sergeants, street thugs');

INSERT INTO `virtue` (`id`, `name`, `details`) VALUES
(1, 'Charity', 'True Charity comes from sharing gifts with others, be it money or possessions, or simply giving time to help another in need. A charitable character is guided by her compassion to share what she has in order to improve the plight of those around her. Charitable individuals are guided by the principle of treating others as they would be treated themselves. By sharing gifts and taking on the role of the Samaritan, they hope to cultivate goodwill in others, and the gifts they give will eventually return to them in their hour of need.\r\n\r\nYour character regains all spent Willpower points whenever she helps another at the risk of loss or harm to herself. It isn’t enough to share what your character has in abundance. She must make a real sacrifice in terms of time, possessions or energy, or she must risk life and limb to help another.\r\n\r\n**Example:** *Deloris could see her dad losing his mind if he knew his little girl was driving around a south-side neighborhood so late at night. But if she wanted to be a top investigative reporter, she had to take some risks, even if it meant tracking down clues on a serial killer in a slum.*\r\n\r\n*She’d been the one to dub him “Tommy 10 Tongues” in her first cover story. Now he was up to 12 tongues, and she was determined to catch him before he harvested another. She knew the police had no idea how to decipher the bloody hieroglyphs at the crime scenes, or why the victims were all missing their tongues. But the police didn’t have an ex-lover who was a linguistics professor.*\r\n\r\n*Then Deloris passed the other motorist. A white man with a cast on one arm struggling to change a flat. If Tommy 10 Tongues didn’t get him, the locals surely would. And yet, Deloris wasn’t born yesterday. The cast could have been a fake. The killer could have used such tricks to lure his victims in. She didn’t want to be the next one, but she couldn’t bear the thought of writing the morning headline, “Stranded Motorist 13th Victim.” So, she pulled over to do the charitable thing.*\r\n\r\n*Deloris gains all spent Willpower for her act of charity. Her willingness to risk herself for someone else validates her defining Virtue.*\r\n\r\n**Other Names:** Compassion, mercy \r\n\r\n**Possessed by:** Philanthropists, saints, soup-kitchen workers'),
(2, 'Faith', 'Those with Faith know that the universe is not random, meaningless chaos, but ordered by a higher power. No matter how horrifying the world might be, everything has its place in the Plan and ultimately serves that Purpose. This Virtue does not necessarily involve belief in a personified deity. It might involve belief in a Grand Unified Theory whereby the seeming randomness of the universe is ultimately an expression of mathematical precision. Or it might be a view that everything is One and that even evil is indistinguishable from good when all discriminating illusions are overcome.\r\n\r\nYour character regains all spent Willpower points whenever he is able to forge meaning from chaos and tragedy.\r\n\r\n**Example:** *Kevin stood at a precipice. Images flashed through his mind: his wife’s bulging eyes, his son’s mutilated body, his daughter’s pink pajamas shredded and matted with hair and blood. Despair and rage whirled up from the psychological chasm before him. He had only to take a step into the cold comfort that the world was meaningless, random and violent, that there could be no God if such evil could come to pass.*\r\n\r\n*No! He didn’t believe it. He couldn’t believe it. Something had done this. Something sick and twisted. Something inhuman. Kevin would find it. God give him strength, he would find it and stop it.*\r\n\r\n*By dedicating himself to finding the meaning of the crime, knowing that there must be a reason for the madness, Kevin regains any spent Willpower points.*\r\n\r\n**Other Names:** Belief, conviction, humility, loyalty\r\n\r\n**Possessed by:** Detectives, philosophers, priests, scientists, true believers'),
(3, 'Fortitude', 'A person’s ideals are meaningless unless they’re tested. When it seems as though the entire world is arrayed against him because of his beliefs, a person possessing Fortitude weathers the storm and emerges with his convictions intact. Fortitude is about standing up for one’s beliefs and holding the course no matter how tempting it may be to relent or give up. By staying the course — regardless of the cost — he proves the worth of his ideals.\r\n\r\nYour character regains all spent Willpower points whenever he withstands overwhelming or tempting pressure to alter his goals. This does not include temporary distractions from his course of action, only pressure that might cause him to abandon or change his goals altogether.\r\n\r\n**Example:** *Noel was absorbed in reading the newspaper when the stranger walked in. The town was opening its eyes to the corruption; his campaign to oust the criminal who called himself ‘mayor’ was working.*\r\n\r\n*The stranger dropped some photos on the desk, breaking Noel’s concentration. They were of Noel 15 years before. The alcoholic years. “I suggest you drop your high and mighty crusade unless you want these on the front page.” Noel instantly recognized that his political career hung in the balance. Was this how it started? Was this how they got their hooks into you?*\r\n\r\n*“Run them,” he said. “I don’t care. You can tell your boss he’s through. He has more to lose than I do.”*\r\n\r\n*By refusing to budge and pressing on in the wake of scandal, Noel behaves in a way that validates his defining Virtue and he regains any spent Willpower points.*\r\n\r\n**Other Names:** Courage, integrity, mettle, stoicism\r\n\r\n**Possessed by:** Dictators, fanatic cultists, gumshoes'),
(4, 'Hope', 'Being hopeful means believing that evil and misfortune cannot prevail, no matter how grim things become. Not only do the hopeful believe in the ultimate triumph of morality and decency over malevolence, they maintain steadfast belief in a greater sense of cosmic justice — whether it’s Karma or the idea of an all-knowing, all-seeing God who waits to punish the wicked. All will turn out right in the end, and the hopeful mean to be around when it happens.\r\n\r\nYour character regains all spent Willpower points whenever she refuses to let others give in to despair, even though doing so risks harming her own goals or wellbeing. This is similar to Fortitude, above, except that your character tries to prevent others from losing hope in their goals. She need not share those goals herself or even be successful in upholding them, but there must be a risk involved.\r\n\r\n**Example:** *The activists’ anger was palpable as Eva entered the room.*\r\n\r\n*“I know you see me as the enemy — Trent Thorson’s daughter. The truth is, I may own Thorson Lumber, but I don’t control it or I’d shut it down. If my uncle has his way, I’ll never have that chance.*\r\n\r\n*“I know his lawyers and thugs are pressuring you to stop the protest, but you can’t give up. You feel the power of that forest. There’s something there, something bigger than any of us that needs to be protected.*\r\n\r\n*“All I came here to say is don’t lose hope. I’ll feed you what information I can from the inside to keep you one step ahead of them. If you give up now, there’ll be nothing left to save.”*\r\n\r\n*By supporting the activists at her own personal expense and risk, Eva regains any spent Willpower.*\r\n\r\n**Other Names:** Dreamer, optimist, utopian\r\n\r\n**Possessed by:** Anti-globalization activists, entrepreneurs, martyrs, visionaries'),
(5, 'Justice', 'Wrongs cannot go unpunished. This is the central tenet of the just, who believe that protecting the innocent and confronting inequity is the responsibility of every decent person, even in the face of great personal danger. The just believe that evil cannot prosper so long as one good person strives to do what is right, regardless of the consequences.\r\n\r\nYour character regains all spent Willpower points whenever he does the right thing at risk of personal loss or setback. The “right thing” can be defined by the letter or spirit of a particular code of conduct, whether it be the United States penal code or a biblical Commandment.\r\n\r\n**Example:** *For five years Malcolm watched the bastard parade into court, smiling through appeal after appeal. His gold-plated lawyers ran circles around the district attorney. Then they settled the class-action suit at such a ridiculously low payment that Malcolm had to wonder how far the bribes went. And the bastard was going free.*\r\n\r\n*Hundreds had been driven insane by the drug he distributed. It made him rich even while it made Malcolm’s sister a corpse... and then a ghost. It was only then that Malcolm realized why she always appeared outside his hall closet. That’s where he kept his gun.*\r\n\r\n*If Malcolm takes the law into his own hands and makes himself a criminal as a result, he acts in a way that validates his defining Virtue and he regains any spent Willpower.*\r\n\r\n**Other Names:** Condemnatory, righteous\r\n\r\n**Possessed by:** Critics, judges, parents, role models'),
(6, 'Prudence', 'The Virtue of Prudence places wisdom and restraint above rash action and thoughtless behavior. One maintains integrity and principles by moderating actions and avoiding unnecessary risks. While that means a prudent person might never take big gambles that bring huge rewards, neither is his life ruined by a bad roll of the dice. By choosing wisely and avoiding the easy road he prospers slowly but surely.\r\n\r\nYour character regains all spent Willpower points whenever he refuses a tempting course of action by which he could gain significantly. The “temptation” must involve some reward that, by refusing it, might cost him later on.\r\n\r\n**Example:** *“Miss Hernandez, you’re an intelligent woman — and a beautiful one, I might add. There are so many benefits available to the people who contribute to our family business. The least of them is the considerable fee we’re offering for your services in this matter.”*\r\n\r\n*“Your offer is generous,” Louise replied, “and I thank you for it. But the types of offshore transactions you propose are tantamount to money laundering and tax evasion. It wouldn’t be prudent for me to jeopardize my legal career by being party to this.”*\r\n\r\n*“You think you know, Miss Hernandez, but I assure you, you have no idea what you’re passing up.”*\r\n\r\n*If Louise passes on the possibility of riches to preserve her job and name, she acts in a way that validates her defining Virtue and regains any spent Willpower.*\r\n\r\n**Other Names:** Patience, vigilance\r\n**Possessed by:** Businessmen, doctors, priests, scientists'),
(7, 'Temperance', 'Moderation in all things is the secret to happiness, so says the doctrine of Temperance. It’s all about balance. Everything has its place in a person’s life, from anger to forgiveness, lust to chastity. The temperate do not believe in denying their urges, as none of it is unnatural or unholy. The trouble comes when things are taken to excess, whether it’s a noble or base impulse. Too much righteousness can be just as bad as too much wickedness.\r\n\r\nYour character regains all spent Willpower when he resists a temptation to indulge in an excess of any behavior, whether good or bad, despite the obvious rewards it might offer.\r\n\r\n**Example:** *Michael pressed Ravera to the pavement and cuffed him. For half his years on the force, Michael had been trying to bring Douglas Ravera to justice.*\r\n\r\n*How many kids had died from Ravera’s peddled junk? How many times had Michael’s family received death threats? How many times had Ravera been collared only to walk on a technicality?*\r\n\r\n*Michael’s mind kept turning back to the unregistered .38 stashed in his patrol car. He could fire some rounds into the car door and put Ravera’s prints on the weapon. Who would doubt that Michael had to kill him in self-defense?*\r\n\r\n*“No,” Michael muttered to himself. He couldn’t lower himself to the same level as this criminal, no matter how tempting. He’d be no better. Instead, he hauled Ravera into the back of the car and slammed the door.*\r\n\r\n*By refusing to give in to extreme and compelling impulses, remaining centered instead, Michael acts in a way that validates his defining Virtue and he regains any spent Willpower.*\r\n\r\n**Other Names:** Chastity, even-temperament, frugality\r\n**Possessed by:** Clergy, police officers, social workers');
