(1, 'Feral Whispers', 1, 8, 17, '> The Kindred with this ability has learned to understand the lesser creatures that surround her, and to speak with them and make herself understood.\n\n**Rank:** •  \n **Action:** Instant  \n **Cost:** —  \n **Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Animal Ken + Animalism\n\n**Roll Results**  \n **Success:** Success indicates that the character can fully communicate with the animal, to whatever degree it is capable.  \n **Exceptional Success:** Exceptional success indicates that the animal is not only communicative but actively helpful, even volunteering information unasked if it considers that information important (so far as its intelligence allows).  \n **Failure:** Failure indicates that the character cannot communicate with the animal.  \n **Dramatic Failure:** A dramatic failure indicates that the character misreads the animal, gaining false information. Additionally, the animal is immune to any further uses of **Animalism** by that character until the next sunset.\n\nIt is the foundation upon which all other Animalism abilities are built, for without understanding there can be no obedience.\n\nThe vampire must initiate eye contact with the animal in question; doing so forges a strong empathic bond between Kindred and beast, allowing communication. This contact is at least partially mental.\n\nThe vampire may either whisper to the animal in her own language (or any language she knows), or she may hiss, bark, chirp or make whatever sounds the animal might use to express itself.\n\n> Some Kindred prefer the latter, feeling that it joins them more closely with the animal in question, though many others deride them for it and consider the practice vulgar.\n\nThe animal, in turn, might make some sort of noise while responding. It might be a growl, a low chirp or anything else. The precise nature of the sound is irrelevant, as the meaning is conveyed mostly via the empathic link. Most animals instinctively respond quietly when answering Feral Whispers, unless the situation is a tense or violent one.\n\nThe Kindred must maintain either eye contact or a constant dialogue with the animal. If she fails to do so for even a single turn, the link is broken and she must reinitiate contact if she wishes to speak further.', 1, 'Speak with animals'),
(2, 'Obedience', 1, 7, 17, '> Having mastered the ability to commune with beasts, the Kindred’s connection with his own feral nature now allows him to command them as well. No longer need he beg, threaten or cajole animals into doing his will. He demands, and they obey as best they can.\n\n**Rank:** ••  \n **Action:** Instant  \n **Cost:** —  \n **Dice Pool:** Presence + Animal Ken + Animalism – animal’s Composure  \n **Special:** Obedience also requires a contested roll if the animal is already under the control of another Kindred with this power (in which case Obedience successes achieved must exceed those rolled for the original vampire).\n\n**Roll Results**  \n **Success:** Success indicates that the animal obeys the character’s orders to the best of its abilities.  \n **Exceptional Success:** Exceptional success indicates that the animal develops a strong, if temporary, affection for the character. It attempts to please and to anticipate orders, even when not actively following a specific command.  \n **Failure:** Failure indicates that the character cannot command or communicate with the animal.  \n **Dramatic Failure:** Dramatic failure indicates that the animal either attacks the character or does the exact opposite of what he commands it to do. In addition, that animal is immune to any further use of **Animalism** by that character until the next sunset.\n\nThe vampire must make eye contact, as with **Feral Whispers**, and convey to an animal precisely what he wants it to do.\n\nThe animal obeys to the best of its ability, but its nature and intelligence might cause it to interpret its orders in unusual ways. Once it has received an order, the animal carries it out, assuming it can be completed before the following sunrise.\n\n**At dawn, the compulsion ceases**, regardless of whether the task is complete or not.', 2, 'Command animals'),
(3, 'Call of the Wild', 1, 7, 17, '> The Kindred is so fully in tune with her own Beast that she can call out in a feral voice — howling, hissing, cawing or the like — that beckons all creatures of a specific type. Any animal of that sort within a given area is compelled to respond, immediately moving toward the Kindred at its fastest possible speed, via the most direct route it can find.\n\n**Rank:** •••  \n **Action:** Instant  \n **Cost:** 1 Vitae  \n **Dice Pool:** Presence + Animal Ken + Animalism\n\n**Roll Results**  \n **Success:** The area of the call is 100 meters for every success rolled. That is, a single success when summoning rats calls all rats within 100 meters. The Storyteller determines how many animals respond based on the environment. Hundreds or thousands of rats might appear in an inner city, while no hawks or coyotes would.  \n **Exceptional Success:** As per a normal success.  \n **Failure:** On a failure, no animals appear.  \n **Dramatic Failure:** All animals of the type called within 100 meters immediately turn hostile toward the character and are immune to any further uses of Animalism by that character until the next sunset.\n\nOnly animals that can **hear** the call are summoned, so creatures that have been deafened or that are insulated from the sound by thick walls or other barriers do not respond. Additionally, **only** natural animals respond to this call — no **hell hounds** or **gargoyles**, for example, answer it.\n\nAnimals that respond to the Kindred’s call **are not automatically under her control**, but they are more easily subjected to other Animalism powers.\n\n**Suggested Modifiers**\n\nThe Storyteller may impose bonuses or penalties to the call based on weather, barriers or other ambient noise, as he feels is appropriate.\n\nA heavy wind might cut down the distance the sound can travel, for instance, imposing a -2 penalty.\n\nAnimals responding to **Call of the Wild** are easier for the beckoning character to influence with other uses of Animalism.  \n Any further use of Animalism on these specific creatures receives a **bonus equal to the number of successes** on the roll to invoke this power. This bonus lasts for the remainder of the scene.', 3, 'Summon animals'),
(4, 'Subsume the Lesser Spirit', 1, 8, 17, '> By locking eyes with an animal, a vampire may psychically enter the creature’s body and possess it as though it were his own. Some Kindred believe that doing so actually transfers the vampire’s soul into the beast, though other, less mystically minded Kindred disagree. Regardless, the animal’s own mind and instincts are completely subsumed, allowing the Kindred free reign to take whatever action she chooses in the creature’s body.\n> \n> The vampire’s own body falls into a torpor-like state and appears for all intents and purposes to be a corpse. Until the character returns, his body cannot be awakened by any means (though Kindred urban legends tell of ghosts possessing such bodies and wreaking havoc). Also, it is whispered among certain circles that some vampires, addicted to the sensations of life they experience while riding an animal, remain too long in that form and forget their true nature.\n\n**Rank:** ••••  \n **Action:** Contested  \n **Cost:** 1 Vitae  \n **Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Animal Ken + Animalism versus animal’s Composure\n\n**Roll Results**  \n **Success:** The character wins the contested action and occupies the animal’s body. He can use **Animalism** but no other Disciplines while doing so.  \n **Exceptional Success:** The character wins the contested action with five or more successes and occupies the animal’s body, and can also use **Auspex** and **Majesty** while doing so.  \n **Failure:** The character loses or ties the contested action and fails to bond with the animal.  \n **Dramatic Failure:** The character fails to bond with the animal; the animal grows hostile and is immune to any further uses of **Animalism** by that character until the next sunset.\n\nIf the roll made for the character wins the contested roll and gets successes **in excess** of the animal’s Composure dots, the character is in total control and his mind remains clear.\n\nHowever if his roll succeeds but garners a number of successes **equal to or lower** than the animal’s Composure dots, a **Willpower** point must be spent for the character to take any actions contrary to the animal’s instincts.\\\\Otherwise, bestial urges and impulses cloud the vampire’s mind.\n\nAdditionally, his character’s consciousness is so closely intertwined with the beast’s that he maintains some bestial behaviors even after returning to his own form.  \n Until the player spends a total of three Willpower points specifically to overcome this effect — the points can’t, say, be spent to gain three extra dice in unrelated rolls — the character continues to think and feel in an animalistic manner.\n\n> This effect has no “hard” mechanical applications, but it should be roleplayed. If the character doesn’t indulge in animalistic activity, the Storyteller should feel free to either dock the character future experience points or spend Willpower automatically for the character when a particularly bestial response is appropriate but not displayed.\n\nWhile possessing an animal, a character can travel as far from his own body as he wishes and is unharmed by daylight, but he must still force himself to stay awake during the day. The vampire may choose to end the possession and return to his body at any time, regardless of distance. This occurs automatically if the vampire fails to remain awake. Any injuries inflicted on the animal also affect the vampire’s body. If the animal dies while the vampire is still present, the Kindred falls into torpor immediately.(Some believe that the soul attempts to find its way back to its own body during this time.)\n\nIf the Kindred’s physical form is destroyed, his psyche remains trapped in the animal until he finally fails to remain awake, at which point his spirit is lost to oblivion and is unrecoverable.\n\nIt is possible, though uncommon, for a vampire to neglect his physical body long enough for it to starve into torpor while he’s “out.” If a vampire’s dormant body slips or is forced into torpor, the vampire’s spirit automatically returns to its body.', 4, 'Possess an animal'),
(5, 'Leashing the Beast', 1, 8, 18, '> The vampire’s connection with the Beast is so powerful that she can manipulate not only the lesser creatures around her, but her own Beast and that of other Kindred.\n\n**Rank:** •••••  \n **Action:** Instant (to affect oneself) or Contested; resistance is reflexive (to affect another)  \n **Cost:** 1 Vitae  \n **Dice Pool**(oneself): Manipulation + Empathy + Animalism  \n **Dice Pool**(another): Manipulation + Empathy + Animalism versus Composure + Blood Potency\n\n**Roll Results**  \n **Success**(oneself): The instant action inspires or calms rage frenzy or Rötschreck in the character herself.  \n **Success**(another): The character gets the most successes and manipulates another’s Beast. Frenzy or Rötschreck rules apply as normal for the remainder of the scene if either is induced.  \n **Exceptional Success:** The character fulfills the instant action or wins the contested roll with five or more successes, and the subject is immediately forced into (or out of) frenzy or Rötschreck. If the subject is forced into frenzy or Rötschreck, he or she remains in that state for the remainder of the scene, regardless of surrounding events or circumstances. Additionally, Willpower cannot be spent to end the frenzy prematurely. If the subject is brought out of frenzy or Rötschreck, he or she is not subject to frenzy or Rötschreck for the remainder of the scene, regardless of surrounding events or circumstances.  \n **Failure:** The character fails the instant action, or loses or ties the contested action and the power fails.  \n **Dramatic Failure**(oneself): The opposite kind of frenzy sought is invoked (Rötschreck when rage frenzy was intended).  \n **Dramatic Failure**(another): The character’s power rebounds and a Willpower point must be spent or she enters either frenzy or Rötschreck, whichever she attempted to influence. Additionally, the subject is immune to any further **Leashing the Beast** attempts by the character until the next sunset.\n\nThis is not overt control, as with \\[\\[#Obedience|Obedience\\]\\] or the \\[\\[Dominate\\]\\] Discipline. Rather, the Kindred learns to rouse the Beast’s instincts, inspiring it — and thus the vampire within whom it lurks — to behave in a certain manner.  \n Of course, communing with the Beast is dangerous even under the best of circumstances, and a few unfortunate Kindred have been destroyed by their own failed attempts to manipulate others’ Beasts.\n\nThe subject must be a vampire and must be within the character’s line of sight. (If the character makes herself the subject, she need not be able to see, so she can do so even in complete darkness or when otherwise blinded.) The player must decide to invoke a **rage frenzy** or **Rötschreck**, or to alleviate either of them.\n\n**Suggested Modifiers**\n\nIf the character knows another’s **Virtue** and/or **Vice**, such knowledge grants a **+1 bonus**, though she must cajole the Beast by specifically focusing on those aspects of the subject’s personality. These bonuses are not cumulative. Knowing a character’s Virtue and Vice nets only a +1 bonus, **not** a +2.\n\nIf this power is turned on a vampire with whom the user has a **blood tie**, a **+2 bonus** is gained.\n\nIf the character is already in frenzy and uses this power to calm herself, a **-2 penalty** applies.', 5, 'Control self and other\'s Beast'),
(6, 'Heightened Senses', 2, NULL, NULL, '> When this power is activated, all of the vampire’s senses sharpen to a razor’s edge, effectively doubling both the range and clarity of all stimuli received.\n> \n> Heightened eyesight allows the vampire to perceive the most minute details of objects at great distances, while a heightened sense of smell might alert a character to the presence of trace amounts of alcohol on a mortal’s breath.\n\n**Rank:** •  \n **Action:** Instant  \n **Cost:** —  \n **Dice Pool:** This power typically involves no roll. The player simply activates the power and explains to the Storyteller what his character is doing and with which sense(s). The Storyteller responds by relating whatever information can be gleaned. The only time a roll comes into play for **Heightened Senses** is when the Storyteller wishes to permit the character a chance to perceive an imminent threat. In this case, the Storyteller may allow the player to add her character’s Auspex dots to a **surprise roll**.\n\n**Special**: This power allows a vampire to see in pitch-black darkness.', 1, 'increase sight, hearing, and oflactory'),
(7, 'Aura Perception', 2, 1, 18, '> With this mystic power, a vampire can open his perceptions to the psychic auras that surround all sentient creatures. Numerous and often-shifting hues and patterns compose these auras, and it can take many years before a vampire becomes truly proficient at reading them correctly with any degree of regularity. Although the strongest emotions predominate, almost every individual has more than one color to his aura at any given time, and an observer can see any number of streaks or flashes of these other colors.\n\n**Rank:** ••  \n **Action:** Instant +2 full turns (Though this is an instant action, it takes more than just a fleeting glance to see the detail in an aura. A character must scrutinize her subject’s aura for two full turns to glean information from it, though only the single, immediate roll is necessary to determine if she can read it successfully.)  \n **Cost:** —  \n **Dice Pool:** Intelligence + Empathy + Auspex – subject’s Composure  \n **Special:** The degree of information provided by **Aura Perception** depends on the number of dices removed from the pool.\n\n**Roll Results**  \n **Success:** The character perceives a number of colors in the subject’s aura equal to the number of successes obtained on the roll.  \n **Exceptional Success:** As per a normal success, with one additional color or degree of emotional intensity discernible to the character.  \n **Failure:** The character can distinguish no information at all.  \n **Dramatic Failure:** The character gleans utterly misleading and wholly inaccurate information.\n\nNote that a failure indicates that no useful information is perceived, while a dramatic failure indicates a false or misleading reading.  \n The Storyteller may therefore wish to make the roll for the player, to keep the true results secret.\n\n“Psychic colors” change with the subject’s mental or emotional state, creating an ever-moving pattern that is as unique to each person as a fingerprint. As a rule, the more powerful the emotions, the more intense the colors, but even this guideline is betrayed by any number of mitigating factors, depending on circumstance. All the same, practice makes perfect; a true master aura-perceiver learns to understand the significance of each whorl and eddy.\n\nDue to the peculiar nature of such creatures’ auras, this power can be used as a means of detecting other supernatural entities. Vampire auras, for example, tend to be extremely pale, regardless of the colors. Werewolf auras are quite the contrary, nearly frantic in their intensity. Mage auras sparkle with power. Ghostly auras flicker like guttering candles.\n\nAn Auspex user who observes someone in the act of lying may recognize that the subject speaks falsely. Intelligence + Empathy + Auspex is rolled versus the subject’s Composure in a contested action. The Auspex user recognizes the lie if the most successes are rolled for him.\n\nApplied toward reading the mood of potential combatants, this power also grants its user a bonus to Initiative equal to the number of successes rolled in activating the effect. Doing so requires that the vampire speaks to or is in the proximity of intended combatants for at least one turn before a fight breaks out. That period of interaction allows the reading vampire to recognize that events are about to turn violent, so he can react with advanced knowledge.\n\nAURA SIGNIFIERS\n\n**Condition — Color**  \n Afraid — Orange  \n Aggressive — Purple  \n Angry — Bright Red  \n Bitter — Brown  \n Calm — Light Blue  \n Compassionate — Pink  \n Conservative — Lavender  \n Depressed — Gray  \n Desirous/Lustful — Deep Red  \n Distrustful — Light Green  \n Envious — Dark Green  \n Excited — Violet  \n Generous — Rose  \n Happy — Vermilion  \n Hateful — Black  \n Idealistic — Yellow  \n Innocent — White  \n Lovestruck — Bright Blue  \n Obsessed — Bright Green  \n Sad — Silver  \n Spiritual — Gold  \n Suspicious — Dark Blue  \n Confused — Mottled, shifting colors  \n Daydreaming — Sharp, flickering colors  \n Diablerist — Black veins in aura  \n Dominated — Controlled Weak, muted aura  \n Frenzied — Rapidly rippling colors  \n Psychotic — Hypnotic, swirling colors  \n Vampire — Aura colors are pale  \n Shapeshifter — Intensely vibrant aura  \n Ghost — Splotchy, intermittent aura  \n Magic Use — Myriad sparkles in aura', 2, 'sense emotions'),
(8, 'The Spirit’s Touch', 2, 2, 6, '> The Kindred’s powers of perception have progressed to the point that he can pick up psychic impressions from objects simply by handling them for a moment or two. Such impressions can tell the vampire who last held the object, when it was last held and even what was done with it in the past.\n\n**Rank:** •••  \n **Action:** Instant  \n **Cost:** —  \n **Dice Pool:** Wits + Occult + Auspex\n\n**Roll Results**  \n **Success:** Success yields a sense of the previous handler or owner’s identity, as well as a reliable vision or sense of the memory in question.  \n **Exceptional Success:** An exceptional success provides a comprehensive or extended chronological understanding of the event and its participants, such as an entire slideshow of images pertaining to the object and its past.  \n **Failure:** Failure indicates that no impressions come through.  \n **Dramatic Failure:** A dramatic failure indicates the psychic equivalent of a “mixed message” or a very believable but entirely false impression.\n\nThese psychic impressions typically come in the form of quick and cryptic images, and as with other Auspex powers, learning how to decipher the information gleaned can be a task all its own. Most impressions (and therefore, most visuals stemming from them) pertain to the last person who handled the object in question, but two circumstances usually preclude such a reading. First, a long-time owner or handler of the object leaves stronger impressions than someone who handled it briefly, if more recently. Second, experiences associated with great emotion — be it hate, passion or fear —often linger in the form of intense psychic impressions on objects. It is these impressions that likely come to the fore over anything more recent or, in all likelihood, far less emotionally significant.\n\nAll that is required in order to glean information from an object by using this power is that the vampire turn the item over in his hands (or otherwise handle it) for a few moments, during which he enters a shallow trance. This trance is the gateway through which psychic snapshots arrive, and anything that prematurely disrupts the trance likely prevents any useful information from being received.\n\nThis power can also be used to glimpse the past of another. The subject must be touched, which could require a roll if the subject is \\[\\[Combat#Dodge|resistant\\]\\]\n\n**Action:** Contested  \n **Dice Pool:** Wits + Occult +Auspex versus the subject’s Resolve + Blood Potency\n\n**Roll Results**  \n **Success:** The most successes are rolled for the reading character. A distorted and blurred glimpse of the event or situation in question passes through his mind. He is left with an intuitive, general understanding of what transpired.  \n **Exceptional Success:** The reading character wins the contested roll with five or more successes. An instantaneous glimpse of the event or situation in question passes through his mind. He implicitly understands every aspect of what happened, essentially as if he were there in the subject’s stead. The reader doesn’t acquire any new traits or capabilities —say, if the subject committed diablerie. The reader simply knows what transpired.  \n **Failure:** The contested roll is lost or tied. No impressions come through.  \n **Dramatic Failure:** Events witnessed from the subject’s eyes are misinterpreted. He seems to have been attacked rather than to have initiated an attack, for example.\n\nThe subject’s roll is reflexive, and he does not know that past events in his existence are perceived.\n\nIf the reader gets the most successes, a vision is received of the subject’s past, all from the subject’s perspective.\n\nWith no time frame or criteria for the event witness, the last dramatic, tense or passionate act performed or experienced by the subject is glimpsed.\n\nIf a specific timeframe or event is focused on, the Auspex user’s roll suffers a **-1 penalty for each night** that has passed since the event.', 3, 'See psychic residues of the past'),
(9, 'Telepathy', 2, 1, 22, '> At this level of advancement of one’s extrasensory perceptions, a vampire may project his consciousness into a nearby individual’s mind. Doing so creates a mental link whereby the Kindred can communicate silently or even scan the surface of the target’s subconscious. The user senses any thought picked up as a voice inside his own mind, and the data can hardly be considered unobtrusive. Nevertheless, this power has the potential to be one of the most potent of the abilities in any vampire’s mystical arsenal. With enough practice, a vampiric telepath can uncover nearly any secret from any sentient being around him.\n\n**Rank:** ••••  \n **Action:** Instant  \n **Cost:** None for a mortal; 1 Willpower for a supernatural subject unless the supernatural subject is willing.  \n **Dice Pool:** Intelligence + Socialize + Auspex – subject’s Resolve  \n **Special:** The degree of information provided by **Aura Perception** depends on the number of dices removed from the pool.\n\n**Roll Results**  \n **Success:** Success allows a character to read from or add a thought to the subject’s mind. See the suggested modifiers list that follows for specific applications of the **Telepathy** power.  \n **Exceptional Success:** Exceptional success at **Telepathy** allows the character to gain an additional piece of information (or an additional aspect to the original insight).  \n **Failure:** Failure results in no link being established, and the character cannot try again for the remainder of the scene.  \n **Dramatic Failure:** Dramatic failure on a **Telepathy** attempt can be disastrous, as the user instantly adopts any derangements present in the target for the rest of the night.\\\\\n\nNote that the player of any subject who is aware that he is being probed or “ridden” may spend a Willpower point to eject the telepath. Each time the telepath sends a message, the subject instantly becomes aware that the thought didn’t originate from his own mind. Each time the telepath digs out a piece of data, Intelligence + Composure is rolled for the subject to detect the intruder.\n\nTelepathy is most effective on the mortal mind. When used on ordinary people, the character can maintain a link as long as he keeps concentrating, and as long as the mortal target does not leave his line of sight for more than a moment or two.\n\nTrying to breach the supernatural mind, however, is a more difficult prospect. A given link is good only for the moment and must be reestablished each time the character wishes to send or dig for thoughts.', 4, 'Communicate mind by mind and read surface thoughts'),
(10, 'Twilight Projection', 2, 1, 6, '> Commonly seen as the pinnacle of Auspex achievement, this power allows a vampire to project her perceptions out of her physical body. Her senses take on an existence of their own, traveling the material world like a spectre.\n\n> Such a form,called a “ghost body,” is immune to fatigue and physical harm, and it can fly at great speeds. Ghost bodies can even go underground at will — anywhere within and below the limit of the lunar sphere.\n\n**Rank:** •••••  \n **Action:** Instant  \n **Cost:** 1 Willpower  \n **Dice Pool:** Intelligence + Occult + Auspex  \n **Special:** The degree of information provided by **Aura Perception** depends on the number of dices removed from the pool.\n\n**Roll Results**  \n **Success:** The Kindred separates her ghost body from her physical body and may venture throughout the world.  \n **Exceptional Success:** As with a normal success, but the separation occurs with ease and the character regains the Willpower point spent.  \n **Failure:** The character cannot separate her consciousness from her body, but may try again at her next opportunity.  \n **Dramatic Failure:** Dramatic failures can be disastrous. They usually result in the character projecting successfully but being flung to an undesired destination (around the world or deep into an unknown place, for example).\n\nInteracting with the physical world or sprit world while using Twilight Projection is impossible. The character has no substance at all, not even spiritual substance — she is merely a projected consciousness. This state can be both a benefit and a drawback, in that the character is unimpeded by obstacles, but is also unable to affect any threats she encounters. It might come to pass that two vampires’ ghost bodies or a projected vampire and a genuine ghost encounter one another. They can communicate as if they were in the real world, but no sorts of physical or mystical exchanges can occur between them.\n\nA projected vampire’s psyche is invisible to most physical beings. A child or animal might intuitively sense the vampire’s presence, or even see him. Another Kindred using Heightened Senses or Aura Perception might spot the projected being by getting the most successes in a Wits + Investigation + Auspex (spotter) versus Resolve + Occult + Auspex (projector) contested roll. Both rolls are made reflexively.\n\nA projecting vampire’s other Disciplines do not work. Her spirit can certainly observe things, but its temporal connection to the body that serves as the conduit for the Kindred’s mystic curse is too tenuous for other mystical powers to manifest.\n\nWhile her consciousness roams, a vampire’s body lies in a torpor-like state on the spot where she left it. As long as her ghost body is active, the character remains ignorant of what goes on around her physical body. If the body is subjected to either torpor or Final Death, the projected psyche is pulled back immediately.\n\nA vampire’s body continues to expend Vitae nightly for the purposes of sustaining itself. The player must succeed on a standard Humanity roll for the ghost body to remain awake during the daytime. The consciousness of a vampire who falls asleep returns to her body and she rises the next night as normal, entirely within the physical world.\n\nA ghost body appears naked and with no possessions. Artifacts that are composed entirely of spirit matter might be employed in this form, but no physical objects transfer over. Likewise, any objects found during the wraithly endeavor cannot be manipulated or return with the character when she finally rejoins her physical body.\n\nA projecting vampire can potentially be barred mystically from returning to her body, or she might become lost and incapable of finding her body again. Rumors also speak of other spirits that can enter a vampire’s vacant body, stranding the Kindred as a ghost body. Denied her own body (or perhaps another one to possess), each night that passes for the ghost body removes a dot of Blood Potency from its essence. When those dots are reduced to zero, the ghost-Kindred suffers **Final Death** and fades into oblivion.\n\n**Suggested Modifiers**\n\nTypically, no modifiers are necessary, but the Storyteller may penalize the activation roll up to two dice in the event of a hastened projection, such as when a vampire abandons her body at the moment of Final Death (after all, a ghost body is better than no body at all).', 5, 'Project own senses into twilight'),
(11, NULL, 3, NULL, NULL, '**Action:** Reflexive  \n **Cost:** 1 Vitae per turn  \n **Dice Pool:** None  \n **Special:** A character may “pre-empt” her own action in a turn to activate Celerity if an opponent acts before her and the vampire wishes to call upon Celerity before the rival’s action is performed. The vampire therefore gets Celerity’s protection bonus early in the turn. Celerity’s Initiative bonus is also added immediately in the turn, potentially moving the vampire’s action before her attacker’s in the Initiative roster. The vampire also gains the benefit of additional Speed for the turn. If one Vitae is spent to keep Celerity active into the next turn, all of these benefits carry over.\n\nNote that Celerity is obviously superhuman in use. Few Princes smile upon uses of Celerity that leave too many curious mortal witnesses unaccounted for.\n\nCelerity cannot be invoked more than once per turn. That is, you may not spend a second Vitae and double the benefits of Celerity in a given turn, though you may spend Vitae across multiple turns to enjoy the benefits over those turns.\n\nIn turns when a character activates her Celerity, her dots in the Discipline are subtracted from any and all attacking characters’ dice pools, as the vampire moves much more quickly than normal and is harder to hit. This penalty to attackers’ pools applies in addition to any armor the Celerity-using character may have, as well as to Defense (though note, like armor, Celerity’s benefits do not diminish based on how many attacks the character faces). Celerity’s protection even applies against firearms.\n\nFor example, if a character has Celerity 3 and activates the Discipline, three dice are subtracted from any assailants’ dice pools.\n\nCelerity also adds to a character’s Initiative during the turnin which it is active. The aforementioned character with Celerity 3 and Initiative 5 would have a basic Initiative modifier of 8 during turns in which his Celerity is active.\n\nFinally, Celerity acts as a modifier to a character’s Speed while it is active. His Speed increases by itself again for each dot of Celerity he possesses. (Simply add one to the value of the character’s Celerity and multiply that number by his Speed.) Characters running while Celerity is active double this figure, as well.\n\nIf a vampire doesn’t activate Celerity until his stage of the Initiative roster in a turn, previous actions taken by others that turn aren’t invalidated.

Further, commands are always interpreted (within reason) in the subject’s best interests.\n\nFor example, if the victim stands on the edge of a roof and the character commands “Jump!” the victim might jump up and down, rather than leap off the roof.\n\nOf course, the victim would probably not leap off the roof even if the character could find a way to order it. Subjects of Command cannot be made to directly harm themselves, so an obviously suicidal order such as “Die!” is ineffective.\n\n“Sleep” and the like causes the subject to follow the order only if she does not believe herself to be in any mortal danger. A character seduced by a Kindred might sleep if so instructed, but one in the middle of a combat or interrogation certainly does not. In such situations, the character merely falls senseless, but only for a turn.\n\nThe vampire may include the command word in a sentence, in order to conceal her use of the power from others. The command itself must be stressed, and the character must make eye contact precisely when that word is spoken. Observers may notice the unusual emphasis, but only the most alert —and those familiar with the Discipline — are likely to realize what has occurred.\n\nIf this power is turned on a vampire with whom the user has a \\[\\[Blood Tie|blood tie\\]\\], a +2 bonus applies to the user’s roll.', 1, 'issue single word verbal command to target'),

The Kindred may activate the imposed thought or command immediately — “Walk over here and open the door” — or he may establish a stimulus that activates the suggestion at a later date — “When you see a man in a blue suit with a red rose in his lapel, you will spill your drink on him.”\n\nThe victim must be able to understand the vampire.\n\nThe Kindred must maintain eye contact only as long as it takes to implant the suggestion or idea.\n\nMesmerize can deliver truly complex and long-term commands, such as following someone, taking notes on her activities and reporting back on the first of the next month. A subject can have only one suggestion implanted at any given time.\n\nThis power lasts for as long as it takes the subject to carry out the required task, or until the character is destroyed or enters torpor. Impossible actions such as, “Count every grain of sand on this beach,” automatically fail to take root in the subject’s mind.\n\nIf, during the course of carrying out the implanted suggestion, the victim realizes he puts himself in danger or acts completely contrary to his normal moral code, **a Resolve roll may be made to shake off the compulsion**. This is a contested roll. Successes rolled must exceed the number of successes obtained for the dominating character when the individual was first mesmerized.\n\n**Action**: Contested  \n **Dice Pool**: Resolve + Blood Potency vs the number of successes obtained when first mesmerized.\n\n**Roll Results**  \n **Success**: The victim escapes the suggestion.  \n **Exceptional Success**: The victim defies the suggestion, and the dominator incurs a -1 penalty to future attempts to Dominate him until the next night.  \n **Failure**: The victim must continue to carry out the command as ordered.  \n **Dramatic Failure**: Not only must the subject continue to carry out the command, no more Resolve rolls may be made to shake the dominator’s control, no matter what the subject is forced to do.\n\nNo matter how strong the dominator’s will is or how many successes he obtains, he cannot make a subject harm himself directly. Any command to commit suicide is therefore ignored, although commands that are likely to lead to harm— such as, “Walk into that crack house and shoot the man in the red shirt” — are enforceable, but subject to the Resolve rolls discussed above.\n\nIf a vampire attempts to Mesmerize a subject who is already under the influence of a previously implanted directive, compare the successes rolled in the attempt against the successes gained during the implantation of the first suggestion. If the character obtains more successes than the previous Kindred, the new command may supplant the old one. If he does not, the original command remains active and the new one fails to take root.

All accumulated successes are lost and the subject continues to remember what happened.\n\n**Special:** Even a single success pacifies the victim for the length of time it takes to complete the process. Both vampire and subject must be safe and relatively composed when this power is used; it cannot be used to calm someone already in combat, for example.\n\nThe power, as with all uses of Dominate, requires eye contact. The Forgetful Mind does not allow for telepathic contact. Instead, the vampire acts much like a hypnotist, asking direct questions to draw answers from the subject, and then describing in detail any new memories she wishes to impose on the victim. Simple alterations, such as blurring brief and recent memories, are easy enough (and very effective for eliminating evidence of feeding or other Masquerade breaches). More comprehensive alterations, up to and including a complete reconstruction of the victim’s past and even identity, are possible albeit substantially more difficult.The victim’s subconscious struggles to resist false memories implanted from without, so the degree to which the vampire details new memories has direct bearing on how fully the subject assimilates them. An incomplete or simplistic false memory shatters much more swiftly and easily than does one with more attention to detail. For instance, “You drove home after work and had a very bad evening” is not likely to hold up. Far more effective would be an account such as:\n\n> “You left work late, due to a last-minute change ordered by the client. You still managed to get stuck in rush hour for an extra 25 minutes, and you were seriously frustrated by the time you pulled off the freeway. There weren’t even any good songs on the radio.\n> \n> Three blocks from home, a cop pulled you over for coasting through a stop sign. At least he only gave you a warning, but it was still just one more hassle.\n> \n> The frozen dinner you microwaved was awful, the TV movie starred some has-been you didn’t like, and the news was depressing.\n> \n> You finally turned off the TV in disgust and went to bed.”\n\nTruly effective use of The Forgetful Mind, then, requires substantial finesse and patience, as well as the ability to carefully and thoroughly think things through ahead of time. It’s fairly simple to sift through a victim’s memories and strip out recent events without even knowing precisely what happened, but doing so leaves a gap in the memory that can lead to further problems.\n\nMost people aren’t comfortable realizing they’ve lost a few hours or a night’s worth of memories, and they’re likely to try to find out what happened.Even new memories that the character imposes rarely have the same strength as the originals, and they can be broken or at least contradicted through investigation. For instance, a victim might not recall that she was attacked by a vampire, but she might remember being bitten, chalking it up to an animal attack or a spider. More vivid memories can return as snippets in dreams or be triggered by an unusual olfactory stimulus or spoken phrase. The process might take weeks or even years before the victim can begin to make sense of these flashes, but even the most effective memory manipulation is far from perfect — or truly permanent.\n\nA vampire may also use The Forgetful Mind to sense whether someone has had her memories altered in this fashion, and he can sometimes use his own power to draw forth and restore the original thoughts. No Kindred may use The Forgetful Mind to restore his own lost or altered memories, however.\n\nTo restore stolen or false memories, or to sense when memories have been altered, a character must possess Dominate at a level equal to or greater than that of the vampire who first tampered with the subject’s mind. If such is the case, the player then makes a contested roll in each stage of the extended action, to be compared against the initial user’s attempt, and must score more successes than the predecessor did.', 3, 'Manipulate target\'s memory');

Conditioning is normally used only on favored or valuable servants and, over sufficient time, makes the character’s efforts to Dominate a subject far easier while making it harder for any other Kindred to do so. Acquiring such complete control over even the weakest mind is no easy task, however, and it normally takes weeks or even months to accomplish.\n\n**Rank:** ••••  \n **Action:** Contested and Extended (6-15+ successes; each roll represents one week of mental manipulation); resistance is reflexive  \n **Cost:** 1 Willpower per roll  \n **Dice Pool:** Wits + Subterfuge + Dominate versus Resolve + Blood Potency\n\n**Roll Results**  \n **Success:** The character wins a contested roll and makes progress in his efforts to suborn the subject’s will.  \n **Exceptional Success:** The character wins a contested roll with five or more successes and makes substantial progress in his efforts to suborn the subject’s will.  \n **Failure:** The character loses or ties a contested roll and the attempt fails.  \n **Dramatic Failure:** All of the user’s successes to date are negated and the subject is immune to the character’s Dominate until the next sunset.\n\nWhile they are undeniably loyal, servants subject to Conditioning lose much of their ability to think for themselves, their own personalities blotted out by the will imposed on them. They follow their orders literally and to the letter, rarely showing any imagination or judgment, or taking the initiative to act on their own. Some Kindred have remarked that, after a sufficiently lengthy period of Conditioning, their servants actually resemble the walking dead more so than their masters.\n\nMortals, thralls, other vampires and other supernatural creatures are all subject to Conditioning, if it can be performed on them over the required period of time.\n\nConditioning does not have any mechanical effect until five more successes are accumulated in excess of the victim’s Willpower dots. (If the subject has Willpower 6, Conditioning begins to take effect once 11 successes are achieved.) Once this benchmark has been reached, all future attempts by the character to use any Dominate ability (including further uses of Conditioning) on the victim receive a +1 bonus, and all attempts by other Kindred to Dominate the subject suffer a -1 penalty. For every additional five successes that are accumulated, the bonus and penalty each increase by one, to a maximum of +5 and -5. The Storyteller, not the player, should keep track of the number of successes accumulated.\n\nOnce the character’s bonus reaches +3, he no longer needs to make eye contact with the Conditioning subject to use any Dominate abilities, though giving orders through artificial or impersonal means (such as by phone) imposes a -5 penalty to that particular attempt.\n\nSubjects of Conditioning are oblivious to the process being inflicted upon them unless they also possess the power.The Storyteller may allow a victim or someone close to him a Wits + Occult roll to recognize that something is wrong. If the roll fails, the process may continue unaffected. If the roll succeeds, an effort may be made to interrupt the process. If the Conditioning vampire is particularly careful about how suggestions and messages are conveyed, the Wits + Occult roll might suffer a -1 penalty. Interrupting the process could mean fleeing the vampire or restraining the subject from meeting the vampire before all the required successes are accumulated.\n\nIt is possible, albeit extremely difficult, to break a subject’s Conditioning after the required successes are gathered. If the victim is isolated from her master for a number of weeks equal to twice the master’s current Conditioning-granted bonus, the bonus drops by one. For example, a subject has been Conditioned for a long time, and her master has achieved a bonus of +4 to Dominate her. If she is kept completely isolated from her master for eight weeks, the bonus drops to +3. Six more weeks, and it drops to +2, and so forth. The subject’s own personality and creativity slowly reawakens during this period, though she still experiences periods of listlessness, depression and desperation. For at least the first few weeks, the subject most likely makes every attempt to return to her master. Until the subject is completely free, it is horrifyingly easy for the vampire to reassert his dominance,as he likely has at least some bonus to Dominate the individual for a long while.\n\nIf the subject of Conditioning is also the thrall of the vampire, all successes on a Conditioning roll are doubled. So, if a vampire seeks to Condition his own ghoul, and he gets three successes to her two in one roll to program the subject, he actually accumulates six successes in that Conditioning session.\n\nIf this power is turned on a vampire with whom the user has a blood tie, a +2 bonus applies.', 4, 'Target brainwashing to make him a slave'),

Her mind now resides within the victim, and her own body falls into a torpor-like state, becoming indistinguishable from a true corpse.

Activating the power requires an instant action. Its capacity is tested whenever challenged. When the power is at its “normal” level, people can speak freely around the vampire as long as they don’t try to defy or criticize him, though their demeanor is marked by an obvious obeisance to the Kindred invoking Sovereignty.  \n Anyone wishing to attack the vampire, however, whether physically, mystically or socially, calls the user’s Sovereignty into question.

Success in the contested action indicates that the character assumes the aspect of whomever the chosen subject most expects to see, and the others see that person as well, even if they have no knowledge of him or her.

Mystical attacks, however, still affect him normally, though mystical attacks that use mundane methods of delivery are similarly ineffective (such as claws or enchanted physical weapons).

Disciplines that do not require a body might still be effective, though.

Rather, it provides an augmentation of physical potential that lasts for the scene in which it is activated, and which affects other rolls.\n\nEach dot of Resilience increases the character’s Stamina by one for the scene in which the Discipline is active. This bonus also increases the character’s Health dots during the scene. Resilience may not be invoked more than once per scene. That is, you may not spend a second Vitae and double the benefits of the power.\n\n> Example: Prince Maxwell is a Ventrue with Resilience 4 and Stamina 4. While returning to his haven, he encounters a resentful Kindred whom he snubbed at Elysium two nights before. Just to be sure, Maxwell activates his Resilience — his Stamina increases to 8 and his Health dots increase to 13 (Size 5 + Stamina 4 + Resilience 4).\n\nAdditionally, Resilience “downgrades” a number of aggravated damage points per scene equal to Resilience dots. This damage becomes lethal instead. Aggravated wounds suffered in excess of the character’s Resilience dots remain aggravated, however. This downgrade doesn’t apply to any aggravated wounds that the vampire already possesses, just to newly acquired ones suffered while Resilience is active. (In the preceding example, Maxwell would be able to downgrade no more than four points in total.)\n\n> Example: Maxwell is engaged in combat with a witch-hunter, who clubs him with a flaming torch. The torch inflicts five points of aggravated damage — but Maxwell’s Resilience of 4 downgrades that to four points of lethal damage, with one point of aggravated damage remaining.\n\nNote that the extra Health dots a character gains in a scene while Resilience is active can have consequences later. If a vampire suffers more damage than he has his usual Health dots, those excess wounds upgrade existing wounds (bashing becomes lethal, lethal becomes aggravated) as per the damage rules on p. 171-172 of the **World of Darkness Rulebook**. In other words, once the character’s Resilience “powers down” at the end of the scene and the extra Health dots that the power confers are lost, he might have to contend with more serious wounds than initially harmed him unless he heals them while Resilience is still active. See the “Temporary Health Dots” sidebar on p. 173 of the **World of Darkness Rulebook** to see what happens when extra Health is lost.\n\nAlso, if a character suffers damage that upgrades her Health chart, Resilience does not downgrade it. For example, if a character with seven Health dots and a single dot of Resilience suffers nine points of lethal damage, that ninth point stays aggravated. The other eight points are recorded normally as lethal (seven for the Health dots plus one for the Resilience), but the ninth stays aggravated as it upgrades the leftmost box on the character’s Health chart. If that’s all the damage the character suffers by the end of the scene, another of those points of lethal damage upgrades to an aggravated wound once Resilience ceases and the character’s Health dots drop to seven again. Kindred with Resilience are advised to be wise in combat, though they might feel invulnerable while invoking the Discipline.', NULL, 'Downgrade damage, increased stamina pool'),

Vigor cannot be invoked more than once per scene. That is, you may not spend a second Vitae and double the benefits of the power. Note also that certain derived traits (such as Speed) might also be affected by the use of Vigor.\n\n> Example: Solomon has Vigor 3 and Strength 4. He is surprised to find a ghoul creeping about his haven after he returns from a meeting with the Prince. Solomon decides to teach this ghoul a lesson and activates his Vigor — his Strength increases to 7 for the duration of the scene. The ghoul’s eyes widen in fear, anticipating the brutal beating she’s no doubt about to receive.\n\nAdditionally, a character’s Vigor affects his ability to jump. The dice pool to jump, as per p. 66 of the **World of Darkness Rulebook**, is Strength + Athletics + any relevant equipment. When using Vigor to augment a jump, the character’s Vigor dots are added to the number of feet leapt per success.\n\nOn a vertical leap, a character jumps (Vigor + one foot per success rolled). For a standing broad jump, the character jumps (Vigor + 2 feet per success rolled).\n\nOn a running jump, the distance jumped is Size + (Vigor + 4 feet per success rolled).\n\n> For example, say a character has Strength 3, Athletics 3, Size 5 and Vigor 2 and makes a vertical leap. Six dice are rolled and three successes are achieved. The character leaps nine feet upward (2 Vigor + 1 foot, multiplied by the three successes rolled). Now say the character makes a running jump.

When swallowed by the Geheim who created it, the stone protects her against the predation of other Kindred and even the most virulent poisons of the world. When swallowed by another Kindred, the bezoar sets off a chain reaction that destroys much of his Vitae.\n\nThe process of creating the bezoar is somewhat complicated. First the Kindred must break down and analyze five points of her own Vitae via the Sanguine Analysis power above. She feeds the resultant mixture to a mammal (which can range in size from a large rat to a goat); the animal rarely wishes to consume the mixture, so Animalism is often necessary to force the matter. The animal dies during the course of the following day, and the Geheim can harvest the stone from its intestines when she awakes at sunset.\n\nA Geheim can possess a number of bezoars equal to her Blood Potency at any given time.

Utilizing it in any of the other procedures of Blut Alchemie grants a one-time bonus of +5. This applies to a single roll, even if the action is extended.\n- The bezoar protects the Kindred who created it from the fangs of other Kindred. By swallowing the bezoar, she temporarily transmutes her blood into a vile poison. Kindred who feed from the Geheim suffer one point of aggravated damage per Vitae taken. This generally induces the drinker to stop, but a Kindred in frenzy may destroy herself in an attempt to drain the Dilettante. The poisoned blood has no unusual effect on non-Kindred. Since Kindred blood quickly loses its potency after being removed from the Kindred, this cannot be used to create poisoned weapons. This protection lasts for a single scene.\n- The bezoar acts as an immediate remedy to the few poisons that can normally affect a vampire. If the Kindred consumes the bezoar during the same turn in which she is poisoned (doing so is an instant action, so long as the bezoar is on her person and she can reach it), she completely ignores the effect of the poison or venom. If consumed in a later turn, the bezoar instantly negates any further effect from the substance.\n- The bezoar interacts violently with the Vitae of other Kindred. If another Kindred consumes the bezoar, he immediately suffers a loss of Vitae equal to the Dilettante’s Blood Potency (at the time the stone was created).

Larger plants, such as trees, that are within the affected area are not harmed (though they may show signs of disease or rot). If the character was attempting to destroy a single larger object, the object loses one point of Structure per success rolled. This bypasses the object’s Durability.  \n **Exceptional Success:** No additional damage is inflicted, but anything destroyed is utterly gone. The plants or object becomes little more than ashes, as if it was completely burned or decomposed.\n\nIn order to destroy a plant, group of insects, or object, the vampire must touch the item or the ground where the living things are located. Simply standing on the ground where the plants or insects are located qualifies. Objects that may be affected by this power must be wholly organic. This power can destroy a cotton shirt, leaving behind only the polyester collar tag and the plastic buttons. However, a shirt made of a synthetic polyester and cotton blend could not be affected. Leather jackets, baseball bats and simple doors are all candidates for defiling. More complex items may require Storyteller adjudication. A couch or sofa, for example, might be susceptible to this power, depending on a number of factors — is the fabric natural or not, does it have a steel frame for the hideaway bed inside?\n\n**Suggested Modifiers**  \n **Modifier - Situation**  \n -1 - Per point of an object’s Size that exceeds the user’s Nburu rating.  \n -2 - The target object has been worked into its form (baseball bat, door).  \n -2 - The character is unable to directly touch the object (wearing shoes or gloves).  \n -4 - The target object has been manufactured (cotton shirt, leather jacket).', 2, 'Kill areas of plants or insects'),
(89, 'Synthesis', 21, NULL, NULL, '> Another tool for stalking prey, watching their mortal charges, and hiding from superior enemies, the Adroanzi developed the ability to meld with the largest of plants. Typically, trees or larger cacti were the most appropriate candidates for applications of this power, which bears some resemblance to the Protean power Meld with the Earth.\n\n**Cost:** 1 Vitae (or more)  \n **Dice Pool:** This power involves no roll.\n\nWith this power, a vampire is able to meld into a plant that is at least the same size as he is. The plant may be either dead or alive, but it cannot be worked into any other form. While he is melded with the plant, the character’s senses are extended from the plant, providing a full 360 degree range of sight, hearing, touch, etc. These senses extend throughout the entire plant. For example, if he melds with a tree that is taller than a nearby wall, he would be able to see over the wall from the vantage point of the tree’s taller branches. As his sense of touch extends throughout the tree, he could feel people climbing or damaging it.\n\nWhen the character “leaves” the plant and ends the Synthesis, he exits the vegetation exactly where he entered it. However, at the cost of 1 Vitae per turn, the melded character can move throughout the plant. He “moves” at half of his Speed within the plant. At the end of the scene, the character is immediately expelled from the plant at the original point of entry (or from where he has “moved” to within the plant). He may end the power at any time, exiting the plant as an instant action. Alternately, he may quickly exit the plant as an element of surprise or to be able to quickly escape. Exiting from the plant in this fashion is a reflexive action and costs one additional Vitae.', 3, 'Meld with a plant, similar to Haven of Soil'),

For a single turn, they swarm him and drain one point of Vitae. This power may not be used again for the remainder of the scene.  \n **Failure:** While some insects are brought forth, they do not swarm and are not under the vampire’s command. The effect ends and may not be initiated again for the rest of the scene. If this was a roll made to continue the use of the power, the insects simply fail to gain enough access to the victim to have any effect. The power still ends, as the frenzied momentum of the attack has been broken.  \n **Success:** The insects follow the user’s command and swarm the victim. See below for details.  \n **Exceptional Success:** As with a success, but the insects use the blood from the victim to continue the power on their own. No Vitae is spent for this use of Hungry Swarms.\n\nThe Adroanzi initiates this power by shedding his own blood (usually through cutting his hand) and flinging it on the ground or in the air around him. This immediately summons any available insects to him, where they can then be directed by the user of this power. Once focused onto a specific target, they cannot be redirected (though the vampire can use the power again on another target). They simply continue to swarm the victim until the effect is ended. The intended target must be within 30 feet of the vampire. Should the target flee and leave this range, the power’s effect ends.\n\nOnce Hungry Swarms is activated, the target takes one point of lethal damage (if living) or loses one Vitae (in the case of a vampire) each turn. Additionally, the swarms obscure the victim’s senses enough to reduce his effectiveness in anything he attempts. All of the victim’s dice pools are reduced by two as long as the power is in effect.\n\nThe player must spend one point of Vitae per turn for the effect to continue. If the Adroanzi has Hungry Swarms activated on multiple targets, he must spend Vitae for all of them (unless the player rolls an exceptional success; see above).\n\n**Suggested Modifiers**  \n **Modifier - Situation**  \n -3 - Character uses the power in an urban setting.  \n -5 - Character uses this power inside a maintained building.', 4, 'Summons and commands a hostile swarm of vermin'),

Also, regardless of whether the victim is willing or unwilling, the player must make a successful roll against degeneration.  \n **Failure:** The target’s memories remain secure and intact. Further, the player of the Usiri must make a successful degeneration roll for his character regardless of whether the victim was willing or unwilling.  \n **Success:** The victim loses all short-term memories, from the present moment back to the beginning of the story. All Skills or Disciplines learned during this time are lost and must be relearned, but at half cost.  \n **Exceptional Success:** The victim of Tabula Rasa loses all memory of his identity. He is unaware of his vampiric condition and knows nothing of who he is, where he is or what has happened to him. He is a true blank slate, in the most complete meaning of the term.\n\n**Suggested Modifiers  \n Modifier - Situation**  \n +1 - Power is focused on, or applies to, a vampire with whom the user has a blood tie.\n\n> **The Ramifications of Tabula Rasa**\n> \n> This is a truly devastating use of the Hypnagogia Discipline. The Storyteller needs to seriously consider the ramifications of what this power can do in the context of a game setting. Think about it: what if a character actually succeeds in erasing the mind of some unsuspecting elder? She no longer knows who or what she even is. It then becomes the job of the players and the Storyteller to incorporate this turn of events into their overall chronicle. What will become of the blanked Kindred’s place in the power structure? What will her sire or her childer do when she is discovered as nothing more than a neonate? What will her covenant leaders do? Retrain her? Destroy her outright? Mold her into the perfect drone? Let her go to fend for herself?\n> \n> Also, Tabula Rasa isn’t the sort of power that the Storyteller should spring on players without some attention to whether they’d find sudden revocation of purchased traits and character memories entertaining. It might be wise to build some way for the memories to return into the story. Perhaps if the character confronts the Usiri who did this to her in the dreamscape, she can battle him and take back her unlife. But then, that raises the question of whether she wanted to lose those memories in the first place...', 5, 'Erase the memory of a torpored subject completely');
