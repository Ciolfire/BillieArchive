Additionally, the animal is immune to any further uses of **Animalism** by that character until the next sunset.\r\n\r\nIt is the foundation upon which all other Animalism abilities are built, for without understanding there can be no obedience. \r\n\r\nThe vampire must initiate eye contact with the animal in question; doing so forges a strong empathic bond between Kindred and beast, allowing communication. This contact is at least partially mental.\r\n\r\nThe vampire may either whisper to the animal in her own language (or any language she knows), or she may hiss, bark, chirp or make whatever sounds the animal might use to express itself.\r\n\r\n>Some Kindred prefer the latter, feeling that it joins them more closely with the animal in question, though many others deride them for it and consider the practice vulgar.\r\n\r\nThe animal, in turn, might make some sort of noise while responding. It might be a growl, a low chirp or anything else. \r\nThe precise nature of the sound is irrelevant, as the meaning is conveyed mostly via the empathic link.\r\nMost animals instinctively respond quietly when answering Feral Whispers, unless the situation is a tense or violent one.\r\n\r\nThe Kindred must maintain either eye contact or a constant dialogue with the animal. If she fails to do so for even a single turn, the link is broken and she must reinitiate contact if she wishes to speak further.'),
(2, 'Obedience', 2, 1, 7, 17, '>Having mastered the ability to commune with beasts, the Kindred’s connection with his own feral nature now allows him to command them as well. No longer need he beg, threaten or cajole animals into doing his will. He demands, and they obey as best they can.\r\n\r\n**Rank:** ••\\\r\n**Action:** Instant\\\r\n**Cost:** —\\\r\n**Dice Pool:** Presence + Animal Ken + Animalism – animal’s Composure\\\r\n**Special:** Obedience also requires a contested roll if the animal is already under the control of another Kindred with this power (in which case Obedience successes achieved must exceed those rolled for the original vampire).\r\n\r\n**Roll Results**\\\r\n**Success:** Success indicates that the animal obeys the character’s orders to the best of its abilities.\\\r\n**Exceptional Success:** Exceptional success indicates that the animal develops a strong, if temporary, affection for the character. It attempts to please and to anticipate orders, even when not actively following a specific command.\\\r\n**Failure:** Failure indicates that the character cannot command or communicate with the animal.\\\r\n**Dramatic Failure:** Dramatic failure indicates that the animal either attacks the character or does the exact opposite of what he commands it to do. In addition, that animal is immune to any further use of **Animalism** by that character until the next sunset.\r\n\r\nThe vampire must make eye contact, as with **Feral Whispers**, and convey to an animal precisely what he wants it to do.\r\n\r\nThe animal obeys to the best of its ability, but its nature and intelligence might cause it to interpret its orders in unusual ways.\r\nOnce it has received an order, the animal carries it out, assuming it can be completed before the following sunrise.\r\n\r\n**At dawn, the compulsion ceases**, regardless of whether the task is complete or not.'),
(3, 'Call of the Wild', 3, 1, 7, 17, '>The Kindred is so fully in tune with her own Beast that she can call out in a feral voice — howling, hissing, cawing or the like — that beckons all creatures of a specific type. Any animal of that sort within a given area is compelled to respond, immediately moving toward the Kindred at its fastest possible speed, via the most direct route it can find.\r\n\r\n**Rank:** •••\\\r\n**Action:** Instant\\\r\n**Cost:** 1 Vitae\\\r\n**Dice Pool:** Presence + Animal Ken + Animalism\r\n \r\n**Roll Results**\\\r\n**Success:** The area of the call is 100 meters for every success rolled. That is, a single success when summoning rats calls all rats within 100 meters. The Storyteller determines how many animals respond based on the environment. Hundreds or thousands of rats might appear in an inner city, while no hawks or coyotes would.\\\r\n**Exceptional Success:** As per a normal success.\\\r\n**Failure:** On a failure, no animals appear.\\\r\n**Dramatic Failure:** All animals of the type called within 100 meters immediately turn hostile toward the character and are immune to any further uses of Animalism by that character until the next sunset.\r\n\r\nOnly animals that can **hear** the call are summoned, so creatures that have been deafened or that are insulated from the sound by thick walls or other barriers do not respond. Additionally, **only** natural animals respond to this call — no **hell hounds** or **gargoyles**, for example, answer it.\r\n\r\nAnimals that respond to the Kindred’s call **are not automatically under her control**, but they are more easily subjected to other Animalism powers.\r\n\r\n**Suggested Modifiers**\r\n\r\nThe Storyteller may impose bonuses or penalties to the call based on weather, barriers or other ambient noise, as he feels is appropriate.\r\n\r\nA heavy wind might cut down the distance the sound can travel, for instance, imposing a -2 penalty.\r\n\r\nAnimals responding to **Call of the Wild** are easier for the beckoning character to influence with other uses of Animalism.\\\r\nAny further use of Animalism on these specific creatures receives a **bonus equal to the number of successes** on the roll to invoke this power.\r\n This bonus lasts for the remainder of the scene.'),
(4, 'Subsume the Lesser Spirit', 4, 1, 8, 17, '>By locking eyes with an animal, a vampire may psychically enter the creature’s body and possess it as though it were his own. Some Kindred believe that doing so actually transfers the vampire’s soul into the beast, though other, less mystically minded Kindred disagree. Regardless, the animal’s own mind and instincts are completely subsumed, allowing the Kindred free reign to take whatever action she chooses in the creature’s body. \r\n>\r\n>The vampire’s own body falls into a torpor-like state and appears for all intents and purposes to be a corpse. Until the character returns, his body cannot be awakened by any means (though Kindred urban legends tell of ghosts possessing such bodies and wreaking havoc). Also, it is whispered among certain circles that some vampires, addicted to the sensations of life they experience while riding an animal, remain too long in that form and forget their true nature.\r\n\r\n**Rank:** ••••\\\r\n**Action:** Contested\\\r\n**Cost:** 1 Vitae\\\r\n**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Animal Ken + Animalism versus animal’s Composure\r\n \r\n**Roll Results**\\\r\n**Success:** The character wins the contested action and occupies the animal’s body. He can use **Animalism** but no other Disciplines while doing so.\\\r\n**Exceptional Success:** The character wins the contested action with five or more successes and occupies the animal’s body, and can also use **Auspex** and **Majesty** while doing so.\\\r\n**Failure:** The character loses or ties the contested action and fails to bond with the animal.\\\r\n**Dramatic Failure:** The character fails to bond with the animal; the animal grows hostile and is immune to any further uses of **Animalism** by that character until the next sunset.\r\n\r\nIf the roll made for the character wins the contested roll and gets successes **in excess** of the animal’s Composure dots, the character is in total control and his mind remains clear.\r\n\r\nHowever if his roll succeeds but garners a number of successes **equal to or lower** than the animal’s Composure dots, a **Willpower** point must be spent for the character to take any actions contrary to the animal’s instincts.\\Otherwise, bestial urges and impulses cloud the vampire’s mind.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, his character’s consciousness is so closely intertwined with the beast’s that he maintains some bestial behaviors even after returning to his own form.\\\r\nUntil the player spends a total of three Willpower points specifically to overcome this effect — the points can’t, say, be spent to gain three extra dice in unrelated rolls — the character continues to think and feel in an animalistic manner.\r\n\r\n>This effect has no “hard” mechanical applications, but it should be roleplayed. If the character doesn’t indulge in animalistic activity, the Storyteller should feel free to either dock the character future experience points or spend Willpower automatically for the character when a particularly bestial response is appropriate but not displayed.\r\n\r\nWhile possessing an animal, a character can travel as far from his own body as he wishes and is unharmed by daylight, but he must still force himself to stay awake during the day. The vampire may choose to end the possession and return to his body at any time, regardless of distance. This occurs automatically if the vampire fails to remain awake. Any injuries inflicted on the animal also affect the vampire’s body. If the animal dies while the vampire is still present, the Kindred falls into torpor immediately.(Some believe that the soul attempts to find its way back to its own body during this time.)\r\n\r\nIf the Kindred’s physical form is destroyed, his psyche remains trapped in the animal until he finally fails to remain awake, at which point his spirit is lost to oblivion and is unrecoverable.\r\n\r\nIt is possible, though uncommon, for a vampire to neglect his physical body long enough for it to starve into torpor while he’s “out.” If a vampire’s dormant body slips or is forced into torpor, the vampire’s spirit automatically returns to its body.'),
(5, 'Leashing the Beast', 5, 1, 8, 18, '>The vampire’s connection with the Beast is so powerful that she can manipulate not only the lesser creatures around her, but her own Beast and that of other Kindred.\r\n\r\n**Rank:** •••••\\\r\n**Action:** Instant (to affect oneself) or Contested; resistance is reflexive (to affect another)\\\r\n**Cost:** 1 Vitae\\\r\n**Dice Pool**(oneself): Manipulation + Empathy + Animalism\\\r\n**Dice Pool**(another): Manipulation + Empathy + Animalism versus Composure + Blood Potency\\\r\n \r\n**Roll Results**\\\r\n**Success**(oneself): The instant action inspires or calms rage frenzy or Rötschreck in the character herself.\\\r\n**Success**(another): The character gets the most successes and manipulates another’s Beast. Frenzy or Rötschreck rules apply as normal for the remainder of the scene if either is induced.\\\r\n**Exceptional Success:** The character fulfills the instant action or wins the contested roll with five or more successes, and the subject is immediately forced into (or out of) frenzy or Rötschreck. If the subject is forced into frenzy or Rötschreck, he or she remains in that state for the remainder of the scene, regardless of surrounding events or circumstances. Additionally, Willpower cannot be spent to end the frenzy prematurely. If the subject is brought out of frenzy or Rötschreck, he or she is not subject to frenzy or Rötschreck for the remainder of the scene, regardless of surrounding events or circumstances.\\\r\n**Failure:** The character fails the instant action, or loses or ties the contested action and the power fails.\\\r\n**Dramatic Failure**(oneself): The opposite kind of frenzy sought is invoked (Rötschreck when rage frenzy was intended).\\\r\n**Dramatic Failure**(another): The character’s power rebounds and a Willpower point must be spent or she enters either frenzy or Rötschreck, whichever she attempted to influence. Additionally, the subject is immune to any further **Leashing the Beast** attempts by the character until the next sunset.\r\n\r\nThis is not overt control, as with [[#Obedience|Obedience]] or the [[Dominate]] Discipline. Rather, the Kindred learns to rouse the Beast’s instincts, inspiring it — and thus the vampire within whom it lurks — to behave in a certain manner.\\\r\nOf course, communing with the Beast is dangerous even under the best of circumstances, and a few unfortunate Kindred have been destroyed by their own failed attempts to manipulate others’ Beasts.\r\n\r\nThe subject must be a vampire and must be within the character’s line of sight. (If the character makes herself the subject, she need not be able to see, so she can do so even in complete darkness or when otherwise blinded.) The player must decide to invoke a **rage frenzy** or **Rötschreck**, or to alleviate either of them.\r\n\r\n**Suggested Modifiers**\r\n\r\nIf the character knows another’s **Virtue** and/or **Vice**, such knowledge grants a **+1 bonus**, though she must cajole the Beast by specifically focusing on those aspects of the subject’s personality.\r\nThese bonuses are not cumulative. Knowing a character’s Virtue and Vice nets only a +1 bonus, **not** a +2.\r\n\r\nIf this power is turned on a vampire with whom the user has a **blood tie**, a **+2 bonus** is gained.\r\n\r\nIf the character is already in frenzy and uses this power to calm herself, a **-2 penalty** applies.'),
(6, 'Heightened Senses', 1, 2, NULL, NULL, '>When this power is activated, all of the vampire’s senses sharpen to a razor’s edge, effectively doubling both the range and clarity of all stimuli received.\r\n>\r\n>Heightened eyesight allows the vampire to perceive the most minute details of objects at great distances, while a heightened sense of smell might alert a character to the presence of trace amounts of alcohol on a mortal’s breath.\r\n\r\n**Rank**: •\\\r\n**Action**: Instant\\\r\n**Cost**: —\\\r\n**Dice Pool**: This power typically involves no roll. The player simply activates the power and explains to the Storyteller what his character is doing and with which sense(s). The Storyteller responds by relating whatever information can be gleaned. The only time a roll comes into play for **Heightened Senses** is when the Storyteller wishes to permit the character a chance to perceive an imminent threat. In this case, the Storyteller may allow the player to add her character’s **Auspex** dots to a **surprise roll**.\r\n \r\n **Special**: This power allows a vampire to see in pitch-black darkness.'),
(7, 'Aura Perception', 2, 2, 1, 18, '>With this mystic power, a vampire can open his perceptions to the psychic auras that surround all sentient creatures. Numerous and often-shifting hues and patterns compose these auras, and it can take many years before a vampire becomes truly proficient at reading them correctly with any degree of regularity. Although the strongest emotions predominate, almost every individual has more than one color to his aura at any given time, and an observer can see any number of streaks or flashes of these other colors.\r\n\r\n**Rank**: ••\\\r\n**Action**: Instant +2 full turns (Though this is an instant action, it takes more than just a fleeting glance to see the detail in an aura. A character must scrutinize her subject’s aura for two full turns to glean information from it, though only the single, immediate roll is necessary to determine if she can read it successfully.)\\\r\n**Cost**: —\\\r\n**Dice Pool**: Intelligence + Empathy + Auspex – subject’s Composure\\\r\n**Special**: The degree of information provided by **Aura Perception** depends on the number of dices removed from the pool.\r\n \r\n**Roll Results**\\\r\n**Success**: The character perceives a number of colors in the subject’s aura equal to the number of successes obtained on the roll.\\\r\n**Exceptional Success**: As per a normal success, with one additional color or degree of emotional intensity discernible to the character.\\\r\n**Failure**: The character can distinguish no information at all.\\\r\n**Dramatic Failure**: The character gleans utterly misleading and wholly inaccurate information.\r\n\r\nNote that a failure indicates that no useful information is perceived, while a dramatic failure indicates a false or misleading reading.\\\r\nThe Storyteller may therefore wish to make the roll for the player, to keep the true results secret.\r\n\r\n“Psychic colors” change with the subject’s mental or emotional state, creating an ever-moving pattern that is as unique to each person as a fingerprint. As a rule, the more powerful the emotions, the more intense the colors, but even this guideline is betrayed by any number of mitigating factors, depending on circumstance. All the same, practice makes perfect; a true master aura-perceiver learns to understand the significance of each whorl and eddy.\r\n\r\nDue to the peculiar nature of such creatures’ auras, this power can be used as a means of detecting other supernatural entities. Vampire auras, for example, tend to be extremely pale, regardless of the colors. Werewolf auras are quite the contrary, nearly frantic in their intensity. Mage auras sparkle with power. Ghostly auras flicker like guttering candles.\r\n\r\nAn Auspex user who observes someone in the act of lying may recognize that the subject speaks falsely. Intelligence + Empathy + Auspex is rolled versus the subject’s Composure in a contested action. The Auspex user recognizes the lie if the most successes are rolled for him.\r\n\r\nApplied toward reading the mood of potential combatants, this power also grants its user a bonus to Initiative equal to the number of successes rolled in activating the effect. Doing so requires that the vampire speaks to or is in the proximity of intended combatants for at least one turn before a fight breaks out. That period of interaction allows the reading vampire to recognize that events are about to turn violent, so he can react with advanced knowledge.'),

(11, NULL, NULL, 3, NULL, NULL, '**Action**: Reflexive\\\r\n**Cost**: 1 Vitae per turn\\\r\n**Dice Pool**: None\\\r\n**Special**: A character may “pre-empt” her own action in a turn to activate \r\nCelerity if an opponent acts before her and the vampire wishes to call upon Celerity before the rival’s action is performed. The vampire therefore gets Celerity’s protection bonus early in the turn. Celerity’s Initiative bonus is also added immediately in the turn, potentially moving the vampire’s action before her attacker’s in the Initiative roster. The vampire also gains the benefit of additional Speed for the turn. If one Vitae is spent to keep Celerity active into the next turn, all of these benefits carry over.\r\n\r\nNote that Celerity is obviously superhuman in use. Few Princes smile upon uses of Celerity that leave too many curious mortal witnesses unaccounted for.\r\n\r\nCelerity cannot be invoked more than once per turn. That is, you may not spend a second Vitae and double the benefits of Celerity in a given turn, though you may spend Vitae across multiple turns to enjoy the benefits over those turns.\r\n\r\nIn turns when a character activates her Celerity, her dots in the Discipline are subtracted from any and all attacking characters’ dice pools, as the vampire moves much more quickly than normal and is harder to hit. This penalty to attackers’ pools applies in addition to any armor the Celerity-using character may have, as well as to Defense (though note, like armor, Celerity’s benefits do not diminish based on how many attacks the character faces). Celerity’s protection even applies against firearms.\r\n\r\nFor example, if a character has Celerity 3 and activates the Discipline, three dice are subtracted from any assailants’ dice pools.\r\n\r\nCelerity also adds to a character’s Initiative during the turnin which it is active. The aforementioned character with Celerity 3 and Initiative 5 would have a basic Initiative modifier of 8 during turns in which his Celerity is active.\r\n\r\nFinally, Celerity acts as a modifier to a character’s Speed while it is active. His Speed increases by itself again for each dot of Celerity he possesses. (Simply add one to the value of the character’s Celerity and multiply that number by his Speed.)\r\nCharacters running while Celerity is active double this figure, as well.\r\n\r\nIf a vampire doesn’t activate Celerity until his stage of the Initiative roster in a turn, previous actions taken by others that turn aren’t invalidated. (They aren’t re-done because the vampire suddenly has a higher standing in the roster.) By activating Celerity “late” in the turn, the vampire forfeits his Initiative bonus that turn. The vampire also gains Celerity’s protection only against attacks that come after his place in the Initiative roster for the turn. If Celerity is kept active into the next turn, the vampire’s Initiative bonus and full protection applies throughout.'),

The force of his personality issues forth in waves, drawing people to him like moths to a flame.\\\r\n>Perhaps the greatest use for Awe is its ability to facilitate public speaking or debate. Whatever the vampire says, people are likely to lend serious credence to his position and views, and even the staunchest opponents gladly hear him out. Awe can often turn the tide in a tense negotiation, tipping the scales from “potentially” to “definitely.”\r\n\r\n**Rank:** •\\\r\n**Action:** Instant\\\r\n**Cost:** —\\\r\n**Dice Pool:** Presence + Expression + Majesty\r\n\r\n**Roll Results**\\\r\n**Success:** The character succeeds in dazzling his intended audience with his overwhelming charisma.\\\r\n**Exceptional Success:** An exceptional success indicates that the subjects’ Composures are considered one less than normal for the purposes of determining who is affected.\\\r\n**Failure:** Failure indicates that the power simply does not activate. The character knows this immediately and may try again next turn.\\\r\n**Dramatic Failure:** A dramatic failure indicates that the character actually makes himself more unappealing, and people actively seek to avoid him until he leaves.\r\n\r\nAs with other Majesty powers, Awe ceases to be useful when more pressing matters come to the fore. Personal safety always takes precedence, and any commotion pulls even the most rapt listener from his reverie of attention. Those subjected to the character’s stature likely remember how good they felt around him, and tailor future reactions accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe number of successes the player acquires is compared to the Composure of each intended subject.\r\n* If the number of successes exceeds a given target’s Composure, that subject is affected by the character’s powerful personality.\r\n* If a subject’s Composure is equal to or higher than the number of successes earned, that subject goes unaffected.\r\n\r\nA character may Awe whomever is present (see the suggested modifiers below), and comparisons are made from lowest Composure to highest among potential subjects. Effectively, a character may not single out an individual subject in a crowd to Awe. He simply “turns on the charm” and lets it work its magic.\r\n\r\nThose individuals affected by Awe raptly fawn over the user. Any social rolls he engages in with them gains a number of bonus dice equal to the number of successes rolled to activate the power.\r\n\r\nThis effect lasts for one scene, and people may well expect to thrill to the character’s presence the next time they see him.'),

No Willpower can be spent to make a Composure roll to stop.\\\r\n**Failure:** The character loses or ties the contested roll. He may try again.\\\r\n**Dramatic Failure:** The vampire’s manipulative efforts are obvious for the intended subject to see. No more of the vampire’s attempts at Revelation on the same subject work for the remainder of the night.\r\n\r\nWhile a vampire can gain the information he seeks by use of this power, he must be prepared for a litany of confessions from a particularly guilty or tormented subject.\r\n\r\nA longtime criminal might have many sins to confess, for example, only one of which is important to the character using Revelation.\r\n\r\nA successful Manipulation + Socialize roll may be required for the vampire to steer the confession to a matter of interest. If the roll fails, the vampire must endure everything that the subject has to say.\r\n\r\nShould the confession go on for more than a single turn, and the subject turns to particularly deep, dark or dangerous secrets, a Willpower point may be spent and a Composure roll made for the subject to break the spell for a turn.\r\n\r\nThe subject remembers what he confessed after the effects of the power have passed.
