Additionally, the animal is immune to any further uses of **Animalism** by that character until the next sunset.\r\n\r\nIt is the foundation upon which all other Animalism abilities are built, for without understanding there can be no obedience. \r\n\r\nThe vampire must initiate eye contact with the animal in question; doing so forges a strong empathic bond between Kindred and beast, allowing communication. This contact is at least partially mental.\r\n\r\nThe vampire may either whisper to the animal in her own language (or any language she knows), or she may hiss, bark, chirp or make whatever sounds the animal might use to express itself.\r\n\r\n>Some Kindred prefer the latter, feeling that it joins them more closely with the animal in question, though many others deride them for it and consider the practice vulgar.\r\n\r\nThe animal, in turn, might make some sort of noise while responding. It might be a growl, a low chirp or anything else. \r\nThe precise nature of the sound is irrelevant, as the meaning is conveyed mostly via the empathic link.\r\nMost animals instinctively respond quietly when answering Feral Whispers, unless the situation is a tense or violent one.\r\n\r\nThe Kindred must maintain either eye contact or a constant dialogue with the animal. If she fails to do so for even a single turn, the link is broken and she must reinitiate contact if she wishes to speak further.'),

It attempts to please and to anticipate orders, even when not actively following a specific command.\\\r\n**Failure:** Failure indicates that the character cannot command or communicate with the animal.\\\r\n**Dramatic Failure:** Dramatic failure indicates that the animal either attacks the character or does the exact opposite of what he commands it to do. In addition, that animal is immune to any further use of **Animalism** by that character until the next sunset.\r\n\r\nThe vampire must make eye contact, as with **Feral Whispers**, and convey to an animal precisely what he wants it to do.\r\n\r\nThe animal obeys to the best of its ability, but its nature and intelligence might cause it to interpret its orders in unusual ways.\r\nOnce it has received an order, the animal carries it out, assuming it can be completed before the following sunrise.\r\n\r\n**At dawn, the compulsion ceases**, regardless of whether the task is complete or not.'),
(3, 'Call of the Wild', 3, 1, 7, 17, '>The Kindred is so fully in tune with her own Beast that she can call out in a feral voice — howling, hissing, cawing or the like — that beckons all creatures of a specific type. Any animal of that sort within a given area is compelled to respond, immediately moving toward the Kindred at its fastest possible speed, via the most direct route it can find.\r\n\r\n**Rank:** •••\\\r\n**Action:** Instant\\\r\n**Cost:** 1 Vitae\\\r\n**Dice Pool:** Presence + Animal Ken + Animalism\r\n \r\n**Roll Results**\\\r\n**Success:** The area of the call is 100 meters for every success rolled. That is, a single success when summoning rats calls all rats within 100 meters. The Storyteller determines how many animals respond based on the environment. Hundreds or thousands of rats might appear in an inner city, while no hawks or coyotes would.\\\r\n**Exceptional Success:** As per a normal success.\\\r\n**Failure:** On a failure, no animals appear.\\\r\n**Dramatic Failure:** All animals of the type called within 100 meters immediately turn hostile toward the character and are immune to any further uses of Animalism by that character until the next sunset.\r\n\r\nOnly animals that can **hear** the call are summoned, so creatures that have been deafened or that are insulated from the sound by thick walls or other barriers do not respond. Additionally, **only** natural animals respond to this call — no **hell hounds** or **gargoyles**, for example, answer it.\r\n\r\nAnimals that respond to the Kindred’s call **are not automatically under her control**, but they are more easily subjected to other Animalism powers.\r\n\r\n**Suggested Modifiers**\r\n\r\nThe Storyteller may impose bonuses or penalties to the call based on weather, barriers or other ambient noise, as he feels is appropriate.\r\n\r\nA heavy wind might cut down the distance the sound can travel, for instance, imposing a -2 penalty.\r\n\r\nAnimals responding to **Call of the Wild** are easier for the beckoning character to influence with other uses of Animalism.\\\r\nAny further use of Animalism on these specific creatures receives a **bonus equal to the number of successes** on the roll to invoke this power.\r\n This bonus lasts for the remainder of the scene.'),
(4, 'Subsume the Lesser Spirit', 4, 1, 8, 17, '>By locking eyes with an animal, a vampire may psychically enter the creature’s body and possess it as though it were his own. Some Kindred believe that doing so actually transfers the vampire’s soul into the beast, though other, less mystically minded Kindred disagree. Regardless, the animal’s own mind and instincts are completely subsumed, allowing the Kindred free reign to take whatever action she chooses in the creature’s body. \r\n>\r\n>The vampire’s own body falls into a torpor-like state and appears for all intents and purposes to be a corpse. Until the character returns, his body cannot be awakened by any means (though Kindred urban legends tell of ghosts possessing such bodies and wreaking havoc). Also, it is whispered among certain circles that some vampires, addicted to the sensations of life they experience while riding an animal, remain too long in that form and forget their true nature.\r\n\r\n**Rank:** ••••\\\r\n**Action:** Contested\\\r\n**Cost:** 1 Vitae\\\r\n**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Animal Ken + Animalism versus animal’s Composure\r\n \r\n**Roll Results**\\\r\n**Success:** The character wins the contested action and occupies the animal’s body. He can use **Animalism** but no other Disciplines while doing so.\\\r\n**Exceptional Success:** The character wins the contested action with five or more successes and occupies the animal’s body, and can also use **Auspex** and **Majesty** while doing so.\\\r\n**Failure:** The character loses or ties the contested action and fails to bond with the animal.\\\r\n**Dramatic Failure:** The character fails to bond with the animal; the animal grows hostile and is immune to any further uses of **Animalism** by that character until the next sunset.\r\n\r\nIf the roll made for the character wins the contested roll and gets successes **in excess** of the animal’s Composure dots, the character is in total control and his mind remains clear.\r\n\r\nHowever if his roll succeeds but garners a number of successes **equal to or lower** than the animal’s Composure dots, a **Willpower** point must be spent for the character to take any actions contrary to the animal’s instincts.\\Otherwise, bestial urges and impulses cloud the vampire’s mind.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, his character’s consciousness is so closely intertwined with the beast’s that he maintains some bestial behaviors even after returning to his own form.\\\r\nUntil the player spends a total of three Willpower points specifically to overcome this effect — the points can’t, say, be spent to gain three extra dice in unrelated rolls — the character continues to think and feel in an animalistic manner.\r\n\r\n>This effect has no “hard” mechanical applications, but it should be roleplayed. If the character doesn’t indulge in animalistic activity, the Storyteller should feel free to either dock the character future experience points or spend Willpower automatically for the character when a particularly bestial response is appropriate but not displayed.\r\n\r\nWhile possessing an animal, a character can travel as far from his own body as he wishes and is unharmed by daylight, but he must still force himself to stay awake during the day. The vampire may choose to end the possession and return to his body at any time, regardless of distance. This occurs automatically if the vampire fails to remain awake. Any injuries inflicted on the animal also affect the vampire’s body. If the animal dies while the vampire is still present, the Kindred falls into torpor immediately.(Some believe that the soul attempts to find its way back to its own body during this time.)\r\n\r\nIf the Kindred’s physical form is destroyed, his psyche remains trapped in the animal until he finally fails to remain awake, at which point his spirit is lost to oblivion and is unrecoverable.\r\n\r\nIt is possible, though uncommon, for a vampire to neglect his physical body long enough for it to starve into torpor while he’s “out.” If a vampire’s dormant body slips or is forced into torpor, the vampire’s spirit automatically returns to its body.'),
(5, 'Leashing the Beast', 5, 1, 8, 18, '>The vampire’s connection with the Beast is so powerful that she can manipulate not only the lesser creatures around her, but her own Beast and that of other Kindred.\r\n\r\n**Rank:** •••••\\\r\n**Action:** Instant (to affect oneself) or Contested; resistance is reflexive (to affect another)\\\r\n**Cost:** 1 Vitae\\\r\n**Dice Pool**(oneself): Manipulation + Empathy + Animalism\\\r\n**Dice Pool**(another): Manipulation + Empathy + Animalism versus Composure + Blood Potency\\\r\n \r\n**Roll Results**\\\r\n**Success**(oneself): The instant action inspires or calms rage frenzy or Rötschreck in the character herself.\\\r\n**Success**(another): The character gets the most successes and manipulates another’s Beast. Frenzy or Rötschreck rules apply as normal for the remainder of the scene if either is induced.\\\r\n**Exceptional Success:** The character fulfills the instant action or wins the contested roll with five or more successes, and the subject is immediately forced into (or out of) frenzy or Rötschreck. If the subject is forced into frenzy or Rötschreck, he or she remains in that state for the remainder of the scene, regardless of surrounding events or circumstances. Additionally, Willpower cannot be spent to end the frenzy prematurely. If the subject is brought out of frenzy or Rötschreck, he or she is not subject to frenzy or Rötschreck for the remainder of the scene, regardless of surrounding events or circumstances.\\\r\n**Failure:** The character fails the instant action, or loses or ties the contested action and the power fails.\\\r\n**Dramatic Failure**(oneself): The opposite kind of frenzy sought is invoked (Rötschreck when rage frenzy was intended).\\\r\n**Dramatic Failure**(another): The character’s power rebounds and a Willpower point must be spent or she enters either frenzy or Rötschreck, whichever she attempted to influence. Additionally, the subject is immune to any further **Leashing the Beast** attempts by the character until the next sunset.\r\n\r\nThis is not overt control, as with [[#Obedience|Obedience]] or the [[Dominate]] Discipline. Rather, the Kindred learns to rouse the Beast’s instincts, inspiring it — and thus the vampire within whom it lurks — to behave in a certain manner.\\\r\nOf course, communing with the Beast is dangerous even under the best of circumstances, and a few unfortunate Kindred have been destroyed by their own failed attempts to manipulate others’ Beasts.\r\n\r\nThe subject must be a vampire and must be within the character’s line of sight. (If the character makes herself the subject, she need not be able to see, so she can do so even in complete darkness or when otherwise blinded.) The player must decide to invoke a **rage frenzy** or **Rötschreck**, or to alleviate either of them.\r\n\r\n**Suggested Modifiers**\r\n\r\nIf the character knows another’s **Virtue** and/or **Vice**, such knowledge grants a **+1 bonus**, though she must cajole the Beast by specifically focusing on those aspects of the subject’s personality.\r\nThese bonuses are not cumulative. Knowing a character’s Virtue and Vice nets only a +1 bonus, **not** a +2.\r\n\r\nIf this power is turned on a vampire with whom the user has a **blood tie**, a **+2 bonus** is gained.\r\n\r\nIf the character is already in frenzy and uses this power to calm herself, a **-2 penalty** applies.'),
(6, 'Heightened Senses', 1, 2, NULL, NULL, '>When this power is activated, all of the vampire’s senses sharpen to a razor’s edge, effectively doubling both the range and clarity of all stimuli received.\r\n>\r\n>Heightened eyesight allows the vampire to perceive the most minute details of objects at great distances, while a heightened sense of smell might alert a character to the presence of trace amounts of alcohol on a mortal’s breath.\r\n\r\n**Rank:** •\\\r\n**Action:** Instant\\\r\n**Cost:** —\\\r\n**Dice Pool:** This power typically involves no roll. The player simply activates the power and explains to the Storyteller what his character is doing and with which sense(s). The Storyteller responds by relating whatever information can be gleaned. The only time a roll comes into play for **Heightened Senses** is when the Storyteller wishes to permit the character a chance to perceive an imminent threat. In this case, the Storyteller may allow the player to add her character’s Auspex dots to a **surprise roll**.\r\n \r\n**Special**: This power allows a vampire to see in pitch-black darkness.'),
(7, 'Aura Perception', 2, 2, 1, 18, '>With this mystic power, a vampire can open his perceptions to the psychic auras that surround all sentient creatures. Numerous and often-shifting hues and patterns compose these auras, and it can take many years before a vampire becomes truly proficient at reading them correctly with any degree of regularity. Although the strongest emotions predominate, almost every individual has more than one color to his aura at any given time, and an observer can see any number of streaks or flashes of these other colors.\r\n\r\n**Rank:** ••\\\r\n**Action:** Instant +2 full turns (Though this is an instant action, it takes more than just a fleeting glance to see the detail in an aura. A character must scrutinize her subject’s aura for two full turns to glean information from it, though only the single, immediate roll is necessary to determine if she can read it successfully.)\\\r\n**Cost:** —\\\r\n**Dice Pool:** Intelligence + Empathy + Auspex – subject’s Composure\\\r\n**Special:** The degree of information provided by **Aura Perception** depends on the number of dices removed from the pool.\r\n \r\n**Roll Results**\\\r\n**Success:** The character perceives a number of colors in the subject’s aura equal to the number of successes obtained on the roll.\\\r\n**Exceptional Success:** As per a normal success, with one additional color or degree of emotional intensity discernible to the character.\\\r\n**Failure:** The character can distinguish no information at all.\\\r\n**Dramatic Failure:** The character gleans utterly misleading and wholly inaccurate information.\r\n\r\nNote that a failure indicates that no useful information is perceived, while a dramatic failure indicates a false or misleading reading.\\\r\nThe Storyteller may therefore wish to make the roll for the player, to keep the true results secret.\r\n\r\n“Psychic colors” change with the subject’s mental or emotional state, creating an ever-moving pattern that is as unique to each person as a fingerprint. As a rule, the more powerful the emotions, the more intense the colors, but even this guideline is betrayed by any number of mitigating factors, depending on circumstance. All the same, practice makes perfect; a true master aura-perceiver learns to understand the significance of each whorl and eddy.\r\n\r\nDue to the peculiar nature of such creatures’ auras, this power can be used as a means of detecting other supernatural entities. Vampire auras, for example, tend to be extremely pale, regardless of the colors. Werewolf auras are quite the contrary, nearly frantic in their intensity. Mage auras sparkle with power. Ghostly auras flicker like guttering candles.\r\n\r\nAn Auspex user who observes someone in the act of lying may recognize that the subject speaks falsely. Intelligence + Empathy + Auspex is rolled versus the subject’s Composure in a contested action. The Auspex user recognizes the lie if the most successes are rolled for him.\r\n\r\nApplied toward reading the mood of potential combatants, this power also grants its user a bonus to Initiative equal to the number of successes rolled in activating the effect. Doing so requires that the vampire speaks to or is in the proximity of intended combatants for at least one turn before a fight breaks out. That period of interaction allows the reading vampire to recognize that events are about to turn violent, so he can react with advanced knowledge.\r\n\r\n###### AURA SIGNIFIERS\r\n<table>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <th>Condition</th>\r\n    <th>Color</th>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Afraid</td>\r\n    <td>Orange</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Aggressive</td>\r\n    <td>Purple</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Angry</td>\r\n    <td>Bright Red</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Bitter</td>\r\n    <td>Brown</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Calm</td>\r\n    <td>Light Blue</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Compassionate</td>\r\n    <td>Pink</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Conservative</td>\r\n    <td>Lavender</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Depressed</td>\r\n    <td>Gray</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Desirous</td>\r\n    <td>Lustful Deep Red</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Distrustful</td>\r\n    <td>Light Green</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Envious</td>\r\n    <td>Dark Green</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Excited</td>\r\n    <td>Violet</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Generous</td>\r\n    <td>Rose</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Happy</td>\r\n    <td>Vermilion</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Hateful</td>\r\n    <td>Black</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Idealistic</td>\r\n    <td>Yellow</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Innocent</td>\r\n    <td>White</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Lovestruck</td>\r\n    <td>Bright Blue</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Obsessed</td>\r\n    <td>Bright Green</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Sad</td>\r\n    <td>Silver</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Spiritual</td>\r\n    <td>Gold</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Suspicious</td>\r\n    <td>Dark Blue</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Confused</td>\r\n    <td>Mottled, shifting colors</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Daydreaming</td>\r\n    <td>Sharp, flickering colors</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Diablerist</td>\r\n    <td>Black veins in aura</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Dominated</td>\r\n    <td>Controlled Weak, muted aura</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Frenzied</td>\r\n    <td>Rapidly rippling colors</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Psychotic</td>\r\n    <td>Hypnotic, swirling colors</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Vampire</td>\r\n    <td>Aura colors are pale</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Shapeshifter</td>\r\n    <td>Intensely vibrant aura</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Ghost</td>\r\n    <td>Splotchy, intermittent aura</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Magic</td>\r\n    <td>Use Myriad sparkles in aura</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>'),
(8, 'The Spirit’s Touch', 3, 2, 2, 6, '>The Kindred’s powers of perception have progressed to the point that he can pick up psychic impressions from objects simply by handling them for a moment or two. Such impressions can tell the vampire who last held the object, when it was last held and even what was done with it in the past.\r\n\r\n**Rank:** •••\\\r\n**Action:** Instant\\\r\n**Cost:** —\\\r\n**Dice Pool:** Wits + Occult + Auspex\r\n \r\n**Roll Results**\\\r\n**Success:** Success yields a sense of the previous handler or owner’s identity, as well as a reliable vision or sense of the memory in question.\\\r\n**Exceptional Success:** An exceptional success provides a comprehensive or extended chronological understanding of the event and its participants, such as an entire slideshow of images pertaining to the object and its past.\\\r\n**Failure:** Failure indicates that no impressions come through.\\\r\n**Dramatic Failure:** A dramatic failure indicates the psychic equivalent of a “mixed message” or a very believable but entirely false impression.\r\n\r\nThese psychic impressions typically come in the form of quick and cryptic images, and as with other Auspex powers, learning how to decipher the information gleaned can be a task all its own. Most impressions (and therefore, most visuals stemming from them) pertain to the last person who handled the object in question, but two circumstances usually preclude such a reading. First, a long-time owner or handler of the object leaves stronger impressions than someone who handled it briefly, if more recently. Second, experiences associated with great emotion — be it hate, passion or fear —often linger in the form of intense psychic impressions on objects. It is these impressions that likely come to the fore over anything more recent or, in all likelihood, far less emotionally significant.\r\n\r\nAll that is required in order to glean information from an object by using this power is that the vampire turn the item over in his hands (or otherwise handle it) for a few moments, during which he enters a shallow trance. This trance is the gateway through which psychic snapshots arrive, and anything that prematurely disrupts the trance likely prevents any useful information from being received.\r\n\r\nThis power can also be used to glimpse the past of another.

He is left with an intuitive, general understanding of what transpired.\\\r\n**Exceptional Success:** The reading character wins the contested roll with five or more successes. An instantaneous glimpse of the event or situation in question passes through his mind. He implicitly understands every aspect of what happened, essentially as if he were there in the subject’s stead. The reader doesn’t acquire any new traits or capabilities —say, if the subject committed diablerie. The reader simply knows what transpired.\\\r\n**Failure:** The contested roll is lost or tied. No impressions come through.\\\r\n**Dramatic Failure:** Events witnessed from the subject’s eyes are misinterpreted. He seems to have been attacked rather than to have initiated an attack, for example.\r\n\r\nThe subject’s roll is reflexive, and he does not know that past events in his existence are perceived.\r\n\r\nIf the reader gets the most successes, a vision is received of the subject’s past, all from the subject’s perspective.\r\n\r\nWith no time frame or criteria for the event witness, the last dramatic, tense or passionate act performed or experienced by the subject is glimpsed.\r\n\r\nIf a specific timeframe or event is focused on, the Auspex user’s roll suffers a **-1 penalty for each night** that has passed since the event.'),

Doing so creates a mental link whereby the Kindred can communicate silently or even scan the surface of the target’s subconscious. The user senses any thought picked up as a voice inside his own mind, and the data can hardly be considered unobtrusive. Nevertheless, this power has the potential to be one of the most potent of the abilities in any vampire’s mystical arsenal. With enough practice, a vampiric telepath can uncover nearly any secret from any sentient being around him.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Rank:** ••••\\\r\n**Action:** Instant\\\r\n**Cost:** None for a mortal; 1 Willpower for a supernatural subject unless the supernatural subject is willing.\\\r\n**Dice Pool:** Intelligence + Socialize + Auspex – subject’s Resolve\\\r\n**Special:** The degree of information provided by **Aura Perception** depends on the number of dices removed from the pool.\r\n\r\n**Roll Results**\\\r\n**Success:** Success allows a character to read from or add a thought to the subject’s mind.

(10, 'Twilight Projection', 5, 2, 1, 6, '>Commonly seen as the pinnacle of Auspex achievement, this power allows a vampire to project her perceptions out of her physical body.

They usually result in the character projecting successfully but being flung to an undesired destination (around the world or deep into an unknown place, for example).\r\n\r\nInteracting with the physical world or sprit world while using Twilight Projection is impossible. The character has no substance at all, not even spiritual substance — she is merely a projected consciousness. This state can be both a benefit and a drawback, in that the character is unimpeded by obstacles, but is also unable to affect any threats she encounters. It might come to pass that two vampires’ ghost bodies or a projected vampire and a genuine ghost encounter one another. They can communicate as if they were in the real world, but no sorts of physical or mystical exchanges can occur between them.\r\n\r\nA projected vampire’s psyche is invisible to most physical beings. A child or animal might intuitively sense the vampire’s presence, or even see him. Another Kindred using Heightened Senses or Aura Perception might spot the projected being by getting the most successes in a Wits + Investigation + Auspex (spotter) versus Resolve + Occult + Auspex (projector) contested roll. Both rolls are made reflexively.\r\n\r\nA projecting vampire’s other Disciplines do not work. Her spirit can certainly observe things, but its temporal connection to the body that serves as the conduit for the Kindred’s mystic curse is too tenuous for other mystical powers to manifest.\r\n\r\nWhile her consciousness roams, a vampire’s body lies in a torpor-like state on the spot where she left it. As long as her ghost body is active, the character remains ignorant of what goes on around her physical body. If the body is subjected to either torpor or Final Death, the projected psyche is pulled back immediately.\r\n\r\nA vampire’s body continues to expend Vitae nightly for the purposes of sustaining itself. The player must succeed on a standard Humanity roll for the ghost body to remain awake during the daytime. The consciousness of a vampire who falls asleep returns to her body and she rises the next night as normal, entirely within the physical world.\r\n\r\nA ghost body appears naked and with no possessions. Artifacts that are composed entirely of spirit matter might be employed in this form, but no physical objects transfer over. Likewise, any objects found during the wraithly endeavor cannot be manipulated or return with the character when she finally rejoins her physical body.\r\n\r\nA projecting vampire can potentially be barred mystically from returning to her body, or she might become lost and incapable of finding her body again. Rumors also speak of other spirits that can enter a vampire’s vacant body, stranding the Kindred as a ghost body. Denied her own body (or perhaps another one to possess), each night that passes for the ghost body removes a dot of Blood Potency from its essence. When those dots are reduced to zero, the ghost-Kindred suffers **Final Death** and fades into oblivion.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Suggested Modifiers**\r\n\r\nTypically, no modifiers are necessary, but the Storyteller may penalize the activation roll up to two dice in the event of a hastened projection, such as when a vampire abandons her body at the moment of Final Death (after all, a ghost body is better than no body at all).'),
(11, NULL, NULL, 3, NULL, NULL, '**Action:** Reflexive\\\r\n**Cost:** 1 Vitae per turn\\\r\n**Dice Pool:** None\\\r\n**Special:** A character may “pre-empt” her own action in a turn to activate \r\nCelerity if an opponent acts before her and the vampire wishes to call upon Celerity before the rival’s action is performed. The vampire therefore gets Celerity’s protection bonus early in the turn. Celerity’s Initiative bonus is also added immediately in the turn, potentially moving the vampire’s action before her attacker’s in the Initiative roster. The vampire also gains the benefit of additional Speed for the turn. If one Vitae is spent to keep Celerity active into the next turn, all of these benefits carry over.\r\n\r\nNote that Celerity is obviously superhuman in use. Few Princes smile upon uses of Celerity that leave too many curious mortal witnesses unaccounted for.\r\n\r\nCelerity cannot be invoked more than once per turn. That is, you may not spend a second Vitae and double the benefits of Celerity in a given turn, though you may spend Vitae across multiple turns to enjoy the benefits over those turns.\r\n\r\nIn turns when a character activates her Celerity, her dots in the Discipline are subtracted from any and all attacking characters’ dice pools, as the vampire moves much more quickly than normal and is harder to hit. This penalty to attackers’ pools applies in addition to any armor the Celerity-using character may have, as well as to Defense (though note, like armor, Celerity’s benefits do not diminish based on how many attacks the character faces). Celerity’s protection even applies against firearms.\r\n\r\nFor example, if a character has Celerity 3 and activates the Discipline, three dice are subtracted from any assailants’ dice pools.\r\n\r\nCelerity also adds to a character’s Initiative during the turnin which it is active. The aforementioned character with Celerity 3 and Initiative 5 would have a basic Initiative modifier of 8 during turns in which his Celerity is active.\r\n\r\nFinally, Celerity acts as a modifier to a character’s Speed while it is active. His Speed increases by itself again for each dot of Celerity he possesses. (Simply add one to the value of the character’s Celerity and multiply that number by his Speed.)\r\nCharacters running while Celerity is active double this figure, as well.\r\n\r\nIf a vampire doesn’t activate Celerity until his stage of the Initiative roster in a turn, previous actions taken by others that turn aren’t invalidated. (They aren’t re-done because the vampire suddenly has a higher standing in the roster.) By activating Celerity “late” in the turn, the vampire forfeits his Initiative bonus that turn. The vampire also gains Celerity’s protection only against attacks that come after his place in the Initiative roster for the turn. If Celerity is kept active into the next turn, the vampire’s Initiative bonus and full protection applies throughout.'),

If the command is ambiguous or confusing, the subject might respond slowly or perform the task poorly. Further, commands are always interpreted (within reason) in the subject’s best interests.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the victim stands on the edge of a roof and the character commands “Jump!” the victim might jump up and down, rather than leap off the roof.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, the victim would probably not leap off the roof even if the character could find a way to order it. Subjects of Command cannot be made to directly harm themselves, so an obviously suicidal order such as “Die!” is ineffective.\r\n\r\n“Sleep” and the like causes the subject to follow the order only if she does not believe herself to be in any mortal danger. A character seduced by a Kindred might sleep if so instructed, but one in the middle of a combat or interrogation certainly does not. In such situations, the character merely falls senseless, but only for a turn.\r\n\r\nThe vampire may include the command word in a sentence, in order to conceal her use of the power from others. The command itself must be stressed, and the character must make eye contact precisely when that word is spoken. Observers may notice the unusual emphasis, but only the most alert —and those familiar with the Discipline — are likely to realize what has occurred.\r\n\r\nIf this power is turned on a vampire with whom the user has a [[Blood Tie|blood tie]], a +2 bonus applies to the user’s roll.'),
(13, 'Mesmerize', 2, 4, 1, 19, '>The source of many legends of the vampire’s hypnotic gaze, Mesmerize allows the Kindred to implant a false thought or suggestion into the subject’s subconscious mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Rank:** ••\\\r\n**Action:** Contested; resistance is reflexive\\\r\n**Cost:** —\\\r\n**Dice Pool:** Intelligence + Expression + Dominate versusResolve + Blood Potency\r\n\r\n**Roll Results**\\\r\n**Success:** The character wins the contested roll by getting the most successes, and the victim obeys to the best of his ability.\\\r\n**Exceptional Success:** The character wins the contested roll with five or more successes. The victim not only obeys, but rationalizes what she does as her own decision until and unless someone questions her about it in depth.\\\r\n**Failure:** The character loses or ties the contested roll and the subject does not obey.\\\r\n**Dramatic Failure:** The subject does not obey and is immune to the character’s Dominate until the next sunset.\r\n\r\nThe power requires not only eye contact but intense concentration and precise wording, so both the character and the subject must be free from distraction. The Kindred may activate the imposed thought or command immediately — “Walk over here and open the door” — or he may establish a stimulus that activates the suggestion at a later date — “When you see a man in a blue suit with a red rose in his lapel, you will spill your drink on him.” \r\n\r\nThe victim must be able to understand the vampire.\r\n\r\nThe Kindred must maintain eye contact only as long as it takes to implant the suggestion or idea.\r\n\r\nMesmerize can deliver truly complex and long-term commands, such as following someone, taking notes on her activities and reporting back on the first of the next month. A subject can have only one suggestion implanted at any given time.\r\n\r\nThis power lasts for as long as it takes the subject to carry out the required task, or until the character is destroyed or enters torpor. Impossible actions such as, “Count every grain of sand on this beach,” automatically fail to take root in the subject’s mind.\r\n\r\nIf, during the course of carrying out the implanted suggestion, the victim realizes he puts himself in danger or acts completely contrary to his normal moral code, **a Resolve roll may be made to shake off the compulsion**. This is a contested roll. Successes rolled must exceed the number of successes obtained for the dominating character when the individual was first mesmerized.\r\n\r\n**Action**: Contested\\\r\n**Dice Pool**: Resolve + Blood Potency vs the number of successes obtained when first mesmerized.\r\n\r\n**Roll Results**\\\r\n**Success**: The victim escapes the suggestion.\\\r\n**Exceptional Success**: The victim defies the suggestion, and the dominator incurs a -1 penalty to future attempts to Dominate him until the next night.\\\r\n**Failure**: The victim must continue to carry out the command as ordered.\\\r\n**Dramatic Failure**: Not only must the subject continue to carry out the command, no more Resolve rolls may be made to shake the dominator’s control, no matter what the subject is forced to do.\r\n\r\nNo matter how strong the dominator’s will is or how many successes he obtains, he cannot make a subject harm himself directly. Any command to commit suicide is therefore ignored, although commands that are likely to lead to harm— such as, “Walk into that crack house and shoot the man in the red shirt” — are enforceable, but subject to the Resolve rolls discussed above.\r\n\r\nIf a vampire attempts to Mesmerize a subject who is already under the influence of a previously implanted directive, compare the successes rolled in the attempt against the successes gained during the implantation of the first suggestion. If the character obtains more successes than the previous Kindred, the new command may supplant the old one. If he does not, the original command remains active and the new one fails to take root. In case of a tie, the original command takes precedent over the new one.\r\n\r\nA vampire seeking to supplant an old suggestion with a new one must also acquire successes in excess of those rolled for the subject in his contested Resolve + Blood Potency roll.\r\n\r\nIf this power is turned on a vampire with whom the user has a [[Blood Tie|blood tie]], a +2 bonus applies to the user’s roll.'),
(14, 'The Forgetful Mind', 3, 4, 2, 21, '>A vampire with this power can literally delve into a subject’s mind, stealing or reshaping memories at whim.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Rank:** •••\\\r\n**Action:** Extended (1-100+ successes, based on the detail and complexity of memory; each roll represents five minutes of mental manipulation)\\\r\n**Cost:** —\\\r\n**Dice Pool:** Wits + Persuasion + Dominate – Resolve\r\n\r\n**Roll Results**\\\r\n**Success:** The character makes headway toward altering a block of memories.\\\r\n**Exceptional Success**: The character makes considerable headway toward altering a block of memories.\\\r\n**Failure:** The attempt fails.\\\r\n**Dramatic Failure:** The attempt fails, and the subject is immune to the character’s Dominate until the next sunset. All accumulated successes are lost and the subject continues to remember what happened.\r\n\r\n**Special:** Even a single success pacifies the victim for the length of time it takes to complete the process. Both vampire and subject must be safe and relatively composed when this power is used; it cannot be used to calm someone already in combat, for example.\r\n\r\nThe power, as with all uses of Dominate, requires eye contact. The Forgetful Mind does not allow for telepathic contact. Instead, the vampire acts much like a hypnotist, asking direct questions to draw answers from the subject, and then describing in detail any new memories she wishes to impose on the victim. Simple alterations, such as blurring brief and recent memories, are easy enough (and very effective for eliminating evidence of feeding or other Masquerade breaches). More comprehensive alterations, up to and including a complete reconstruction of the victim’s past and even identity, are possible albeit substantially more difficult.The victim’s subconscious struggles to resist false memories implanted from without, so the degree to which the vampire details new memories has direct bearing on how fully the subject assimilates them. An incomplete or simplistic false memory shatters much more swiftly and easily than does one with more attention to detail. For instance, “You drove home after work and had a very bad evening” is not likely to hold up. Far more effective would be an account such as:\r\n\r\n>“You left work late, due to a last-minute change ordered by the client. You still managed to get stuck in rush hour for an extra 25 minutes, and you were seriously frustrated by the time you pulled off the freeway. There weren’t even any good songs on the radio.\r\n>\r\n>Three blocks from home, a cop pulled you over for coasting through a stop sign. At least he only gave you a warning, but it was still just one more hassle.\r\n>\r\n>The frozen dinner you microwaved was awful, the TV movie starred some has-been you didn’t like, and the news was depressing.\r\n>\r\n>You finally turned off the TV in disgust and went to bed.”\r\n\r\nTruly effective use of The Forgetful Mind, then, requires substantial finesse and patience, as well as the ability to carefully and thoroughly think things through ahead of time. It’s fairly simple to sift through a victim’s memories and strip out recent events without even knowing precisely what happened, but doing so leaves a gap in the memory that can lead to further problems.\r\n\r\nMost people aren’t comfortable realizing they’ve lost a few hours or a night’s worth of memories, and they’re likely to try to find out what happened.Even new memories that the character imposes rarely have the same strength as the originals, and they can be broken or at least contradicted through investigation. For instance, a victim might not recall that she was attacked by a vampire, but she might remember being bitten, chalking it up to an animal attack or a spider. More vivid memories can return as snippets in dreams or be triggered by an unusual olfactory stimulus or spoken phrase. The process might take weeks or even years before the victim can begin to make sense of these flashes, but even the most effective memory manipulation is far from perfect — or truly permanent.\r\n\r\nA vampire may also use The Forgetful Mind to sense whether someone has had her memories altered in this fashion, and he can sometimes use his own power to draw forth and restore the original thoughts. No Kindred may use The Forgetful Mind to restore his own lost or altered memories, however.\r\n\r\nTo restore stolen or false memories, or to sense when memories have been altered, a character must possess Dominate at a level equal to or greater than that of the vampire who first tampered with the subject’s mind. If such is the case, the player then makes a contested roll in each stage of the extended action, to be compared against the initial user’s attempt, and must score more successes than the predecessor did.');

(15, 'Conditioning', 4, 4, 2, 24, '>Through constant veiled whispers, subtle hints and frequent sustained manipulation, a vampire can slowly render a particular victim substantially more suggestible. Conditioning is normally used only on favored or valuable servants and, over sufficient time, makes the character’s efforts to Dominate a subject far easier while making it harder for any other Kindred to do so. Acquiring such complete control over even the weakest mind is no easy task, however, and it normally takes weeks or even months to accomplish.\r\n\r\n**Rank:** ••••\\\r\n**Action:** Contested and Extended (6-15+ successes; each roll represents one week of mental manipulation); resistance is reflexive\\\r\n**Cost:** 1 Willpower per roll\\\r\n**Dice Pool:** Wits + Subterfuge + Dominate versus Resolve + Blood Potency\r\n\r\n**Roll Results**\\\r\n**Success:** The character wins a contested roll and makes progress in his efforts to suborn the subject’s will.\\\r\n**Exceptional Success:** The character wins a contested roll with five or more successes and makes substantial progress in his efforts to suborn the subject’s will.\\\r\n**Failure:** The character loses or ties a contested roll and the attempt fails.\\\r\n**Dramatic Failure:** All of the user’s successes to date are negated and the subject is immune to the character’s Dominate until the next sunset.\r\n\r\nWhile they are undeniably loyal, servants subject to Conditioning lose much of their ability to think for themselves, their own personalities blotted out by the will imposed on them. They follow their orders literally and to the letter, rarely showing any imagination or judgment, or taking the initiative to act on their own. Some Kindred have remarked that, after a sufficiently lengthy period of Conditioning, their servants actually resemble the walking dead more so than their masters.\r\n\r\nMortals, thralls, other vampires and other supernatural creatures are all subject to Conditioning, if it can be performed on them over the required period of time.\r\n\r\nConditioning does not have any mechanical effect until five more successes are accumulated in excess of the victim’s Willpower dots. (If the subject has Willpower 6, Conditioning begins to take effect once 11 successes are achieved.) Once this benchmark has been reached, all future attempts by the character to use any Dominate ability (including further uses of Conditioning) on the victim receive a +1 bonus, and all attempts by other Kindred to Dominate the subject suffer a -1 penalty. For every additional five successes that are accumulated, the bonus and penalty each increase by one, to a maximum of +5 and -5. The Storyteller, not the player, should keep track of the number of successes accumulated.\r\n\r\nOnce the character’s bonus reaches +3, he no longer needs to make eye contact with the Conditioning subject to use any Dominate abilities, though giving orders through artificial or impersonal means (such as by phone) imposes a -5 penalty to that particular attempt.\r\n\r\nSubjects of Conditioning are oblivious to the process being inflicted upon them unless they also possess the power.The Storyteller may allow a victim or someone close to him a Wits + Occult roll to recognize that something is wrong. If the roll fails, the process may continue unaffected. If the roll succeeds, an effort may be made to interrupt the process. If the Conditioning vampire is particularly careful about how suggestions and messages are conveyed, the Wits + Occult roll might suffer a -1 penalty. Interrupting the process could mean fleeing the vampire or restraining the subject from meeting the vampire before all the required successes are accumulated.\r\n\r\nIt is possible, albeit extremely difficult, to break a subject’s Conditioning after the required successes are gathered. If the victim is isolated from her master for a number of weeks equal to twice the master’s current Conditioning-granted bonus, the bonus drops by one. For example, a subject has been Conditioned for a long time, and her master has achieved a bonus of +4 to Dominate her. If she is kept completely isolated from her master for eight weeks, the bonus drops to +3. Six more weeks, and it drops to +2, and so forth. The subject’s own personality and creativity slowly reawakens during this period, though she still experiences periods of listlessness, depression and desperation. For at least the first few weeks, the subject most likely makes every attempt to return to her master. Until the subject is completely free, it is horrifyingly easy for the vampire to reassert his dominance,as he likely has at least some bonus to Dominate the individual for a long while.\r\n\r\nIf the subject of Conditioning is also the thrall of the vampire, all successes on a Conditioning roll are doubled. So, if a vampire seeks to Condition his own ghoul, and he gets three successes to her two in one roll to program the subject, he actually accumulates six successes in that Conditioning session.\r\n\r\nIf this power is turned on a vampire with whom the user has a blood tie, a +2 bonus applies.'),

The mortal enters something of a fugue state while possessed, and he is aware of events only in a dreamlike, distorted fashion. The Kindred suffers the opposite effect. Her mind now resides within the victim, and her own body falls into a torpor-like state, becoming indistinguishable from a true corpse.

Complete success brings the subject as quickly as possible within the space of one night, without questioning the motivations or origins of the summons.\\\r\n**Exceptional Success:** The character wins the contested roll with five or more successes. An exceptional success draws the subject to the vampire with all deliberate haste, no matter how long the journey takes. The compulsion to arrive prevails even during daylight, and the subject’s sense of the summoner’s location persists throughout.\\\r\n**Failure:** The character loses or ties the contested roll. The subject remains unaware of the Summoning, and nothing happens.\\\r\n**Dramatic Failure:** The target is aware that the vampire tried to summon him, and is immune to that vampire’s Summoning attempts for the rest of the story.\r\n\r\nThere is no limit on the distance or range of this power, but summoning someone halfway around the world takes time, even under the best of circumstances. The subject of Summoning takes the most direct possible routes to the vampire’s location and intuitively knows when the vampire moves, though doesn’t necessarily know the final destination until he gets there (it’s like a sort of direction sense).\r\n\r\nThe summoned individual knows to whose presence he travels, and he may pause to make arrangements before departure, if necessary. In other words, the compulsion is strong and the subject doesn’t dilly-dally unnecessarily, but he is hardly a single-minded drone in his desire to reach the vampire. The subject does, however, use any resources at his disposal to see that he arrives both safely and punctually.\r\n\r\nThe call of a summoning fades with the first rays of the sun at dawn. Therefore, if a subject is truly far away or a sufficiently fast means of transportation is not available to him, he can deny the compulsion to attend the summoner at dawn.\r\n\r\nIndeed, he could return home and go about his business. If the subject is predisposed toward the summoner, however, he may continue the quest of his own accord. During the day, he is under his own power to find the vampire and loses his “direction sense.”\r\n\r\nAnother vampire is not compelled to seek the summoner to the very light of day, causing his Final Death. The seeker finds shelter beforehand.\r\n\r\nUnless the subject already knows where and how to reach the summoning vampire, the call must be repeated each night until the subject arrives. If, as in the preceding case with the resistant subject, the distance is too far or available transportation is too slow, the subject might never arrive. He falls into a cycle of being drawn to and fleeing from the summoner.\r\n\r\nIf a Willpower point is spent and a Composure + Blood Potency roll is made for a subject to resist this power, any success defies a summons for a whole night, not just a turn or a scene.'),

The assailant may attack, use Disciplines or criticize for the rest of the scene without having to make challenges to the character’s Sovereignty.\r\n\r\nThe vibe the vampire gives off makes others quick to surrender, and the thought of risking his displeasure quails even the heartiest souls. Raising one’s voice to a sovereign Kindred seems unthinkable; aggressing upon him seems impossible. The power of this level of Majesty is a terrifying thing to behold, and a difficult thing to rein in once it’s let loose. Elders are wise not to abuse it or use it too flippantly, as its power is most effective when used both sparingly and exactingly. Despite its mighty prowess, Sovereignty is a finely honed tool — a scalpel, rather than a sword.\r\n\r\nSovereignty is considered “always active” during scenes in which it is invoked, though it may be turned off at the Kindred’s discretion. Activating the power requires an instant action. Its capacity is tested whenever challenged. When the power is at its “normal” level, people can speak freely around the vampire as long as they don’t try to defy or criticize him, though their demeanor is marked by an obvious obeisance to the Kindred invoking Sovereignty.\r\n<br>\r\nAnyone wishing to attack the vampire, however, whether physically, mystically or socially, calls the user’s Sovereignty into question.

Intentions to speak an ill word about or at the sovereign vampire invoke the same contested roll. If the effort fails, the would-be critic cannot bring himself to say what he wishes to.\r\n\r\nIf the presiding vampire responds to aggression by physically attacking back, he breaks his Sovereignty with respect to that subject alone. Use of a Discipline in a damaging or negative way against a would-be aggressor also breaks the spell against that individual alone.

As with all Obfuscate abilities, a character with Auspex might be able to see through Touch of Shadow (though he would still have to find the object normally if it were inside a pocket or otherwise physically concealed from view). Once the character does anything to draw attention to the object — such as deliberately showing it to someone or using it to attack or threaten — Touch of Shadow ends. If someone successfully detects the item, he can point it out to others.

With the expenditure of an additional three experience points, however, the vampire can select another natural substance from the following list: wood, water, natural stone or processed stone. “Processed stone” includes varieties of prepared surfacing materials such as concrete and asphalt. He can now meld into soil and this extra substance with equal ease. Thus, if his player spends 12 experience points, a vampire can rest in all five materials — virtually anywhere. Note that there must still be enough of a substance to accommodate the vampire’s form in roughly his natural Size. (A large tree trunk might suffice, but a small branch does not.) Those who meld with water leave a barely visible, humanoid-shaped outline just below the surface, but are otherwise just as protected and concealed as though they were inside soil.'),
(34, 'Claws of the Wild', 3, 8, NULL, NULL, '>Upon activation of this power, the vampire’s nails grow into long, fearsome talons, capable of rending bone and flesh alike. This power makes many Gangrel truly fearsome combatants, and other Kindred tend to give them a wide berth. Note that not every vampire’s claws look the same. Some seem to be modeled after real-world animals’, such as wolves’, tigers’ or the talons of birds of prey, while other claws seem to have no natural correlative at all. As might be expected, when these last vampires unsheathe their claws, they tend to greatly unnerve those around them.\r\n\r\n**Rank**: •••\\\r\n**Action**: Reflexive\\\r\n**Cost**: 1 Vitae\\\r\n**Dice Pool**: This power involves no roll. The wicked claws grow by silent act of will on the part of the vampire, and they can be sprouted from both a vampire’s hands and feet.\r\n\r\nImbued with the unholy power of Vitae, these ferocious weapons offer a +1 bonus to attack pools in unarmed close combat, and inflict aggravated damage. Of course, these bonuses require that the character actually attacks with his claws — one cannot invoke Claws of the Wild and then gain a +1 bonus and aggravated damage if attacking with an axe or pistol, for example.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their combat potential, the claws add two dice to any climbing-related rolls as long as they remain invoked. The claws remain for the scene unless the vampire retracts them prematurely.'),
(35, 'Shape of the Beast', 4, 8, NULL, NULL, '>The canon of vampire legend is filled with stories of undead lords taking the semblance of the “children of the night.” This power is the source of those legends. With it, a Kindred can take the shape of an ordinary animal, most commonly a bat or a wolf. While in this form, the vampire retains his mind and temperament, but he can call upon the physical qualities of his newfound body (increased speed and senses as a wolf, sonar sense and flight as a bat).\r\n\r\n**Rank**: ••••\\\r\n**Action**: Instant\\\r\n**Cost**: 1 Vitae\\\r\n**Dice Pool**: This power requires no roll to activate. The transformation from human to animal or back again requires a character’s action in a turn.\r\n\r\nWith time and experience, the character can learn to adopt the other form (bat or wolf) or others.\r\n\r\nAll clothing and small possessions shift with the vampire, and he can remain in his animal state until he chooses to shift back. A vampire can even sleep the day away in animal form, but must still avoid sunlight, which always affects vampires regardless of form. In addition, sleeping in animal form is taxing on the vampiric state, requiring the expenditure of an additional Vitae upon awakening.\r\n\r\nWhile in animal form, a vampire can use any Discipline in his repertoire except for Theban Sorcery, Crúac and Dominate (which becomes impossible when one tries to bark and yip commands). Each animal form conveys a separate host of benefits.\r\n\r\nAs a wolf, the vampire’s claws and teeth inflict lethal damage and add a +1 bonus to attack pools, Speed is doubled, and two bonus dice are added to any Wits + Composure rolls to be aware of events that happen in the wolf ’s environment.\r\n\r\nAs a bat, the vampire’s Strength becomes 1, but he can fly at a Speed of 20 (plus five more per dot of Vigor activated); three dice are added to all hearing-based rolls, and Defense increases by two.\r\n\r\n(At the player’s discretion, he may spend another Vitae and allow a character in wolf form or any other suitable form as described here to activate Claws of the Wild. As with normal uses of that power, these claws are obviously supernatural or otherwise remarkable, and even those unfamiliar with the world of the Damned will know that something is not quite right about the animal in question. A character who has assumed Shape of the Beast and also activates Claws of the Wild gains a +1 bonus to attack pools and inflicts aggravated damage instead of gaining a +1 bonus to attack pools and inflicting lethal damage with claw attacks.)\r\n\r\nWhen this power is first acquired, only bat or wolf form is available. With Storyteller permission, every three experience points spent allows a character access to the other form, or to an altogether different predatory animal, usually a mammal, although it’s rumored that Kindred in far-flung lands can assume the forms of predatory and scavenger birds. Storytellers are encouraged to use the models given here and on p. 202-203 of the **World of Darkness Rulebook** as examples of animal traits.\r\n\r\nA vampire in animal form is not subject to the Animalism Discipline. Dominate may still be used on him in whatever form — human or animal — he assumes.'),
(36, 'Body of Spirit', 5, 8, NULL, NULL, '>The pinnacle of most vampires’ achievement in the transfiguring art, this power enables a Kindred to transform his entire body into a fine, chilling mist. As a small cloud of vapor, the character can float along above the ground at his normal Speed, slipping under doors and in between screens with ease. Although especially strong winds can divert him from his desired course for a time, not even gale-force winds can fully disperse his misty essence.\r\n\r\n**Rank**: •••••\\\r\n**Action**: Instant\\\r\n**Cost**: 1 Vitae\\\r\n**Dice Pool**: This power involves no roll to invoke. The full change takes one action to complete.\r\n\r\nIf a strong enough wind picks up, the character’s vaporous body could be subjected to unwanted direction change if he does not resist successfully. Roll Strength (plus any Vigor that the vampire activates). There’s no modifier for a light wind. A strong one imposes a -1 penalty, and a galeforce wind imposes a -3 penalty. A success allows the vampire to travel in any direction desired for the turn, even against the wind. An exceptional success allows him to travel in any direction for the remainder of the scene. A failure indicates that the vampire is pushed by the wind for one turn at the speed it travels. And a dramatic failure causes the vampire to blow out of control (but still as a cohesive whole) for the entire scene.\r\n\r\nWhile in mist form, the character is immune to all physical attacks, which merely pass through his gaseous body. Mystical attacks, however, still affect him normally, though mystical attacks that use mundane methods of delivery are similarly ineffective (such as claws or enchanted physical weapons). Even fire and sunlight inflict one less point of damage than normal. The trade-off, of course, is that a vampire in this state cannot physically attack anyone (not even another vampire using this power). Disciplines that do not require a body might still be effective, though. A vampire in gaseous form can use any Discipline he knows except for Theban Sorcery, Crúac and Dominate (which is useless when he has no eyes with which to make contact and no mouth with which to speak commands).\r\n\r\nA vampire in mist form cannot be “bottled” or otherwise trapped in part by someone trying to contain or disrupt his form. Bottling a portion of a vampire’s mist doesn’t cause him to resume human form without an arm, for example. A vampire’s entire mist form can be contained in a room or other large space that is airtight. Of course, the question arises of how one can lure a vampire in mist form into an airtight room, or how one even has access to an airtight room.'),
(37, NULL, NULL, 9, NULL, NULL, '**Action**: Instant\\\r\n**Cost**: 1 Vitae per scene\\\r\n**Dice Pool**: Resilience is unlike many other Disciplines in that it is not actively rolled. Rather, it provides an augmentation of physical potential that lasts for the scene in which it is activated, and which affects other rolls.\r\n\r\nEach dot of Resilience increases the character’s Stamina by one for the scene in which the Discipline is active. This bonus also increases the character’s Health dots during the scene. Resilience may not be invoked more than once per scene. That is, you may not spend a second Vitae and double the benefits of the power.\r\n\r\n>Example: Prince Maxwell is a Ventrue with Resilience 4 and Stamina 4. While returning to his haven, he encounters a resentful Kindred whom he snubbed at Elysium two nights before. Just to be sure, Maxwell activates his Resilience — his Stamina increases to 8 and his Health dots increase to 13 (Size 5 + Stamina 4 + Resilience 4).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Resilience “downgrades” a number of aggravated damage points per scene equal to Resilience dots. This damage becomes lethal instead. Aggravated wounds suffered in excess of the character’s Resilience dots remain aggravated, however. This downgrade doesn’t apply to any aggravated wounds that the vampire already possesses, just to newly acquired ones suffered while Resilience is active. (In the preceding example, Maxwell would be able to downgrade no more than four points in total.)\r\n\r\n>Example: Maxwell is engaged in combat with a witch-hunter, who clubs him with a flaming torch. The torch inflicts five points of aggravated damage — but Maxwell’s Resilience of 4 downgrades that to four points of lethal damage, with one point of aggravated damage remaining.\r\n\r\nNote that the extra Health dots a character gains in a scene while Resilience is active can have consequences later. If a vampire suffers more damage than he has his usual Health dots, those excess wounds upgrade existing wounds (bashing becomes lethal, lethal becomes aggravated) as per the damage rules on p. 171-172 of the **World of Darkness Rulebook**. In other words, once the character’s Resilience “powers down” at the end of the scene and the extra Health dots that the power confers are lost, he might have to contend with more serious wounds than initially harmed him unless he heals them while Resilience is still active. See the “Temporary Health Dots” sidebar on p. 173 of the **World of Darkness Rulebook** to see what happens when extra Health is lost.\r\n\r\nAlso, if a character suffers damage that upgrades her Health chart, Resilience does not downgrade it. For example, if a character with seven Health dots and a single dot of Resilience suffers nine points of lethal damage, that ninth point stays aggravated. The other eight points are recorded normally as lethal (seven for the Health dots plus one for the Resilience), but the ninth stays aggravated as it upgrades the leftmost box on the character’s Health chart. If that’s all the damage the character suffers by the end of the scene, another of those points of lethal damage upgrades to an aggravated wound once Resilience ceases and the character’s Health dots drop to seven again. Kindred with Resilience are advised to be wise in combat, though they might feel invulnerable while invoking the Discipline.'),
(38, NULL, NULL, 10, NULL, NULL, '**Action**: Instant\\\r\n**Cost**: 1 Vitae per scene\\\r\n**Dice Pool**: Vigor is unlike many other Disciplines in that it is not actively rolled. Rather, it provides an increase of physical strength that lasts the duration of the scene in which it is activated, affecting other rolls.\r\n\r\nEach dot of Vigor increases the character’s Strength by one while the Discipline is active. Vigor cannot be invoked more than once per scene. That is, you may not spend a second Vitae and double the benefits of the power. Note also that certain derived traits (such as Speed) might also be affected by the use of Vigor.\r\n\r\n>Example: Solomon has Vigor 3 and Strength 4. He is surprised to find a ghoul creeping about his haven after he returns from a meeting with the Prince. Solomon decides to teach this ghoul a lesson and activates his Vigor — his Strength increases to 7 for the duration of the scene. The ghoul’s eyes widen in fear, anticipating the brutal beating she’s no doubt about to receive.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a character’s Vigor affects his ability to jump. The dice pool to jump, as per p. 66 of the **World of Darkness Rulebook**, is Strength + Athletics + any relevant equipment. When using Vigor to augment a jump, the character’s Vigor dots are added to the number of feet leapt per success.\r\n\r\nOn a vertical leap, a character jumps (Vigor + one foot per success rolled). For a standing broad jump, the character jumps (Vigor + 2 feet per success rolled). \r\n\r\nOn a running jump, the distance jumped is Size + (Vigor + 4 feet per success rolled).\r\n\r\n>For example, say a character has Strength 3, Athletics 3, Size 5 and Vigor 2 and makes a vertical leap. Six dice are rolled and three successes are achieved. The character leaps nine feet upward (2 Vigor + 1 foot, multiplied by the three successes rolled). Now say the character makes a running jump. The character crosses a base of 5 feet + another 6 (2+4) per success rolled. If he gets three successes, that’s 23 feet (6 more feet then he would have achieved without Vigor).'),
