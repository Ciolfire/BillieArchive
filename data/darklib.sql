(1, 'intelligence', 'mental', 'power', 'The raw power of the mind. Cognitive capacity. The inherent capability to digest, comprehend and remember information — and to learn more. Intelligence is a direct measure of how smart your character is. She may be dull-minded or have narrow-vision. She may be book-smart, or she may simply be able to grasp concepts, interpret situations and solve problems quickly. Intelligence is valued by planners, theorists, scholars, white-collar employees and leaders.', '“I’m sick of this,” Becky announced in frustration. She immediately regretted her outburst as her words echoed throughout the musty old library. Fortunately, this late at night, even during exams, no one else was there to hear. She had been working on her thesis for weeks without getting anywhere. Once again, she wondered if a degree in Linguistics was a good choice.\r\n\r\nHer research was simply not panning out as she hoped, but after another pep talk, she forced herself back into the stacks. What other choice did she have? It was when reaching for a book on Sanskrit that she made her real discovery. A dusty old volume that seemed to have fallen between bookcases. It was bound in leather — or something like it — and had no publication date. Indeed, the book was nothing like she had ever seen before. No end papers. No table of contents. It just launched into some strange text.\r\n\r\nThe next thing she knew, Becky had passed hours studying the book. It had characters reminiscent of Latin and Greek, yet different, with odd pictographs throughout. As near as she could tell, it was dedicated to a religion or to ceremonies of some kind, but from what culture she had no idea. She did know that if she was ever going to find out, she would need more time with it.'),
(2, 'wits', 'mental', 'finesse', 'The ability to think on one’s feet, under pressure or duress, without letting them see you sweat. W its also encompasses an eye for detail, the ability to absorb what’s going on in the environment, and to react to events. It might mean recognizing that the temperature in a room slowly drops, that a landscape painting incorporates a disguised human face, or that a trap is about to be sprung. Wits involves the powers of perception and response. Your character may be oblivious, dumbfounded, quick-eyed or wary. The trait is useful for entrepreneurs, charlatans, athletes, tacticians, lawyers and criminals.', 'Martin had accepted some weird jobs, but this one took the cake. He’d installed or repaired plumbing across the city. He liked the work; jobs could be challenging and fun. Busting open drywall and messing with pipes was like tinkering with the skeleton of a building. You got to see straight into people’s private worlds. Sometimes you even got to peek at the skeletons in their closets. \r\n\r\nBut why be hired to do a full re-pipe at this place and be told not to go on the top floor? Martin had to know. So, when the greasy guy who hired him caught him at the top of the stairs, Martin had to think fast.\r\n\r\n“Yeah, I tried to find you. It’s uh... it’s what I was afraid of. An old building like this, the fittings have given way from wood rot or something. We’re, uh... we’re gonna need to re-route all the pipes upstairs instead of running the same lines.”\r\n\r\nDamn, that was good, he thought. Might be able to squeeze some extra bucks out of this job. The other man didn’t seem convinced.'),
(3, 'resolve', 'mental', 'resistance', 'The focus and determination to see your character’s will done. The capacity to stay on target, ignore distractions and to resist coercion or browbeating. Resolve is your character’s mental fortitude. His personal conviction. His clarity of vision or spirit. Your character may be easily distracted, unable to concentrate, resolute or single-minded. The trait is pivotal to resisting supernatural forms of mental control; it acts as a veritable defense of the mind. Resolve is valuable to leaders, motivators, soldiers, athletes, police and organizers.\r\n\r\n(Note: Resolve is not to be confused with Willpower. Resolve is your character’s ongoing focus. Think of it as his long-term purpose, like a career plan. Willpower reflects your character’s short-term highs and lows, his ability to dedicate himself in brief efforts to overcome challenges. Resolve does contribute to your character’s Willpower dots, though)', 'Josh only really came to his senses when he threw up in the toilet. He had been conscious the whole time, he knew, but it was like he’d been in a daze, walking around like a zombie. He thought back to how it all happened. He’d left his apartment a few hours ago to run errands. It was a nice enough day for winter. He’d gotten some groceries, and then...\r\n\r\nAll he could remember was a blur. Something was there. Big. Strange. He remembered eyes, like an animal’s. They stared straight into his soul in a weird, almost primitive way. It was like his lizard brain kicked in and told him to run and hide, like a rabbit under the shadow of a hawk.\r\n\r\nJosh had a fleeting glimpse of the oranges he’d just bought rolling across the sidewalk, and then all he knew was being back in his apartment, getting sick. How did he get there? Why did he come back? How come he couldn’t remember? And what was that thing? Josh wasn’t sure, but he wasn’t content to let it go, either.\r\n'),
(4, 'strength', 'physical', 'power', 'Physical might. Sheer bodily power. The capacity to lift objects, move items, hit things and people, and do damage. Strength is a measure of muscle. Your character could be 98-pound weakling, he could carry a spare tire, or he could be lean and cut or bulky and brawny. Your character’s Strength score is used in hand-to-hand combat. This trait is instrumental to laborers, thugs, athletes, brawlers and law-enforcement agents.\n\nStrength, along with Dexterity, is a factor in determining your character’s Speed.\n\nStrength is also added to Brawl or Weaponry attacks to determine the amount of harm your character inflicts in combat.', '“God damn,” Martin grunted as he pulled on the drain cover in the basement. Somehow, water was still backing up in the system. Everything else checked out, so it had to be a clog in the outtake to the sewer.\r\n\r\nThe building was so old that it still had a dirt-floor basement, yet the drain cover was stuck like a son of a bitch.\r\n\r\n“I could dig around it,” Martin thought, “but that would take time.” This was the last place he wanted to be pulling late hours. The whole building and the guy who hired him really gave him the creeps. It was like the guy resented Martin being there, as if the plumber was intruding on something the guy wanted for himself.\r\n\r\n“Fuck it,” Martin thought, and went to his truck to get a crowbar. Jamming it between grilles, he pried with everything he had. He pushed so hard he thought he was going to piss himself, when the cover cracked loose with a clang.\r\n\r\nAiming his flashlight down the hole, Martin saw something he couldn’t explain. Like a man who’d done this work for years, he reached down the pipe to his shoulder. When he pulled his arm free, his hand was coated red.'),
(5, 'dexterity', 'physical', 'finesse', 'Quickness. Response time. A delicate touch. Dexterity indicates how quickly and with how much finesse your character responds to his physical world. While high Wits dots helps your character spot trouble, high Dexterity dots help him react to it, whether with a counteraction or to simply get the hell out of the way. Dexterity also helps with hand-eye coordination, be it to fire an accurate shot, to juggle objects or to perform delicate jobs such as handle explosives. Your character might be sluggish, clumsy, slight, quick or nimble. Dexterity is invaluable to criminals, sports stars, surgeons and dancers.\r\n\r\nDexterity, along with Strength, is a factor in determining your character’s Speed.\r\n\r\nDexterity is also combined with Composure to determine your character’s Initiative in a fight.', 'Josh had retraced his steps back to where he fell, to where he saw that thing. He turned on the sidewalk, surveying his neighborhood. It wasn’t the best place to live, but he couldn’t afford any better. The worst of it was the bums and homeless, but they left him alone if he gave them some change.\r\n\r\nJosh snapped out of his daydream and realized that he’d been staring glassy-eyed at the alley across the street. There was something about it. He shook his head to clear it and waited for a couple cars to pass.\r\n\r\nThe alley lay between rundown tenements and ran past an old parking lot. No one parked there anymore. Cardboard boxes and scattered blankets used by bums blocked the way. Josh almost turned back, not wanting to piss off the street people, but then he remembered how angry he got back home.\r\n\r\nHe steeled himself and headed down the alley. Almost immediately, open hands reached out from what looked like heaps of trash or discarded clothing as the homeless muttered for money. After a moment, their pleas turned to angry shouts as Josh ventured further into their territory. Panicking, Josh jumped up the chain-link fence next to him. It was the closest escape route. He wished he hadn’t when he got to the barbwire at the top, but forced himself upward and over. He didn’t quite make it, and the rusted steel tore through his pants and into his leg.'),
(6, 'stamina', 'physical', 'resistance', 'Sturdiness. Steadfastness. Sheer physical resilience. Stamina is a measure of how tough your character is. It indicates how far she can push her body, and how much physical abuse she can endure. Your character might be sickly and frail, or hardy and unstoppable. Bouncers, brawlers, triathletes, survivalists, heavy lifters and workaholics thrive on Stamina.\r\n\r\nStamina, along with Size, is a factor in determining your character’s Health dots.', 'Becky thanked the pizza guy absently as she closed her apartment door. His nose wrinkled in distaste, not because she failed to tip him but because of the smell of her room, because of her greasy hair and because of her clearly unwashed appearance.\r\n\r\nBecky never noticed the silent insult. She hadn’t really noticed anything for weeks. In fact, eating had become something that she had to remind herself to do. Now it was the book that consumed her. Even as she pushed aside scattered and wadded up papers to sit down, she kept her nose in the book. It demanded every ounce of her attention. Translating and understanding it had become her obsession. It superceded sleep, food, even her thesis. At first, she hoped the book would be invaluable to her research. Now she pored over it for its own sake. If she kept studying, kept interpreting. She knew comprehension would come. As the night wore on, Becky continued to work. The pizza box went unopened.'),
(7, 'presence', 'social', 'power', 'Bearing. Stature. Assertiveness. Presence suggests the power of your character’s very identity. Attractiveness is only part of the trait. Your character may be jaw-dropping gorgeous, plain-Jane or downright ugly, but her Presence means much more. It reflects her sheer command over the attention of others. It’s her capacity to impose her will on others by being socially aggressive or powerful — a veritable bull in a china shop or someone who simply doesn’t accept no for an answer. This trait is essential to leaders, enforcers, interrogators, models, politicians and salespeople.\r\n\r\nNote that attractiveness alone is represented by the Striking Looks Merit, which grants bonus dice to Presence rolls.', 'Martin was stunned. He wasn’t sure how long he stared at the blood on his hand, bewildered by what it might mean. Was the guy who owned the place some kind of psycho, killing people and pouring their blood down the drain? He wasn’t sure, but he finally decided that he didn’t want to find out. It was weird, though. It was like he couldn’t think straight. This should have scared the shit out of him, and here he was kind of out of it, like he’d had a few.\r\n\r\nWhen he got upstairs, he realized the lights were on. It was already dusk outside, given the last light coming in through the windows. “When did that happen,” he wondered. “I meant to—” \r\n\r\nHis thought went unfinished. Standing before him at the foot of the stairs was the most beautiful woman he’d ever seen. Normally, he didn’t go for brunettes. They reminded him of his ex-, but somehow this one made it work. Did she ever. \r\n\r\n“What was I doing?” Martin muttered, but no answer came.\r\n\r\nThe woman’s dark eyes contrasted her pale skin, and focused intently on the blood on Martin’s hand, on the blood that he’d absently smeared across his shirt.\r\n\r\n“Did you hurt yourself?” the woman asked. “Here, let me make it better.”\r\n'),
(8, 'manipulation', 'social', 'finesse', 'Charm. Persuasiveness. Charisma. The capacity to play upon the desires, hopes and needs of others to influence them. Manipulation reflects your character’s finesse in social situations. How well he can appeal to, gain the favor of and generally coerce others. Manipulation is applied to win smiles, to put people at ease or to gain favors. Where Presence deals in social force, Manipulation focuses on social subtlety. It’s the tool and trade of businesspeople, politicians, salesfolk and publicists. Your character may be a wallflower, he could frequently make off-color statements, he might have a winning smile and a hardy handshake, or he may be able to sell sand in the desert.', '“What the fuck am I doing?” Josh wondered as he picked his way down the trash-strewn hallway. “This is exactly where I didn’t want to go.”\r\n\r\nHe had evaded the homeless people in the alley, but then had nowhere to go except into one of the old tenements. His leg burned from the long scratches the fence left him. He hoped his tetanus shot was up to date; he couldn’t remember. The place smelled like piss. He could hear music blaring somewhere, and a baby crying. “Who could raise a kid here?” he wondered.\r\n\r\nHe didn’t have time to think about the answer, though. His eyes were suddenly drawn from the stained carpet to the light at the end of the hall. Three shapes filled it. Two more turned the corner behind him. They were the people from outside. Maybe they weren’t so homeless, after all.\r\n\r\nOn the verge of panic once again, Josh recognized one of the men. “Hey, Eddy, it’s me, Josh. What’s going on?”\r\n\r\nThe five dirty, disheveled men stopped a few feet away, with menacing looks on their faces. “What are you doing here, Josh?” Eddy asked. “I was looking for somethi— a guy. I thought I saw him go in here. Maybe you could help me find him? I think I got a couple bucks....”\r\n\r\n“We don’t want your fucking money.” For a second, Josh wondered if he saw that same bestial look that he’d seen earlier that day — but this time in Eddy’s eyes.'),
(9, 'composure', 'social', 'resistance', 'Poise. Dignity. The capacity to remain calm and appear — and actually be — unfazed in social and threatening situations, usually harrowing ones. Your character might lose his temper at the slightest perceived insult, collapse emotionally under a mere pretense, weather a storm of verbal (or literal) slings and arrows, or have the nerve to look unspeakable horror in the eye. This trait is a measure of emotional fortitude, restraint and calm. It’s ideal among leaders, soldiers, moderators and anyone whose movements are public consumption. Composure is vital to resisting social influence and pressure — overt, covert or otherworldly.\r\n\r\nComposure is pivotal to resisting supernatural forms of emotional control; it acts as a veritable emotional defense. The trait is also vital to efforts among supernatural beings such as vampires and werewolves to restrain themselves when their blood is raised and frenzy threatens.\r\n\r\nComposure, along with Resolve, is a factor in determining your character’ s Willpower.\r\n\r\nComposure is also added to Dexterity to determine your character’s Initiative at the beginning of a fight.', '“Do you understand now?” the priest asked.\r\n\r\nBecky was in shock. Moments before, she’d stormed to her door, ready to unleash her frustration on whomever had dared to interrupt her. Her research had not gone well. The meaning or purpose of the book still eluded her, and she was at the end of her rope.\r\n\r\nOnce she recovered sufficiently from the shock of finding a priest at her door, she answered. “What?”\r\n\r\n“Do you understand now? About the book? About what it says?” Becky continued her look of disbelief. How could this perfect stranger — and a man of the cloth — know anything about her, or more importantly the book?\r\n\r\n“I see,” he continued as he let himself in and shut the door.\r\n\r\nBecky didn’t object. She could scarcely complete a thought.\r\n\r\n“You might be confused. I understand. Rest assured, though, you’re the one. The book chose you. It knows you’re ready. Well, almost. That’s why I’m here. I’m here to help open your eyes.” And with that, everything Becky had stared at and studied moved about in her mind like the pieces of a puzzle. They spun, crisscrossed and overlapped — and finally formed a complete picture. Looking at it was like looking at the sun. It was like staring into the void and knowing that the void stared back. In that moment, Becky’s mind snapped.');

(1, 'Daeva', 'Other Kindred envy their beauty and grace, their ability to incite passion in mortals, the ease with which they glide through the masses — and that envy is almost as potent a draught to the Daeva as blood itself. These Kindred are consummate predators, and they would seem to be the perfect vampires. Alas, most are too dead inside to enjoy it.\r\n\r\nCalled Succubi by other clans, the Daeva are experts at making their prey come to them, practically offering themselves not merely as food but as playthings. No self-respecting Daeva resorts to attacking transients in alleyways. Rather, these are the Kindred who accompany a smitten young mortal back to her place, leaving her languid and sexually spent by morning (if she’s fortunate) or an exsanguinated husk (if she’s not). Seducers and sensualists, the Daeva could practically charm the unease off a Nosferatu. When the fancy strikes them, they play politics like a finely tuned instrument. Even allies and coconspirators who know they cannot trust a Succubus find themselves lulled into doing just that, caught up in the Daeva’s personal magnetism. Daeva become Harpies more than Kindred of any other clan, and they wield that power mercilessly. A stinging rebuke from a Daeva Harpy can shred a vampire’s reputation faster than a denunciation by the Prince himself.\r\n\r\nMost Succubi are overtly sensual beings, drawn by beauty and blood in equal measure, but it’s an artificial passion. Their ability to feel true attachment to other people atrophies over years of manipulating the love of mortals and the respect of their fellow Kindred, until the Daeva can no longer understand those emotions as anything other than tools to be exploited and motions to imitate. For all their apparent fervor, most Succubi are as dead spiritually as they are physically. They claim to understand desire, but all they truly know is need, and it is this deadening of emotions that causes so many jaded Daeva to become depraved in their efforts to feel again.\r\n\r\nDaeva move through the circles of society in which their lustful natures best serve them, whether among high society or low culture. Drawn to beauty and congregations of mortals, they often frequent theaters, galleries, trendy clubs, whiskey dives, drug dens, brothels and everything in between. Personal preferences aside, the Succubi are found through all strata of society. Their seductive natures allow these vampires to find willing vessels no matter where they go, and this ability has enabled them to thrive, to become arguably one of the most numerous clans. No single social class has room for them all, so newcomers and losers of political and social games often find themselves dwelling among the poor and unwashed — or at least the middle classes, which, since their blood is as red as any other, means basically the same thing to most Succubi. Few Kindred are as desperate as a Daeva trying to claw his way into his own niche. Wise Kindred know better than to take advantage of a Daeva in such a position, for fear he’ll one night achieve the position and privilege he seeks. The Succubi never forget a slight.\r\n\r\n**Nickname:** Succubi (male Daeva are sometimes called Incubi, but the clan itself is referred to by the more common female sobriquet)\r\n\r\n**Covenant:** The majority of these Kindred are found within the Invictus. They are well suited to the political game, and here they can surround themselves with lessers, becoming ever more jaded and inhuman as they grow older. Most Daeva are too self-centered to feel the religious calling of the Lancea Sanctum, but those few exceptions who are able to channel their sensual drive into matters of faith often obtain positions of prominence, making the clan seem more numerous in the Lancea Sanctum than it really is. Few Daeva bother with the Carthians. Why fight for an egalitarian society when the current system favors the Daeva? The Ordo Dracul covenant is home to a small number of devoted Daeva, and it would have more if the rigors of the covenant’s policies didn’t make being a hedonist among its ranks less than rewarding. The Circle of the Crone has few Daeva for much the same reasons as the Lancea Sanctum, and those who do join often do so more out of a debased and jaded sense of rebellion against societal mores than any real belief in the Pagans’ teachings. A surprising number of Succubi fall in among the unaligned, convinced, in their own self-perceived superiority, that they have no need for the laws and restrictions of society.\r\n\r\n**Appearance:** Daeva often Embrace out of infatuation — or at least going through the motions of passion — and they rarely choose to involve themselves with unattractive mortals. Thus, most Daeva are surpassingly beautiful. The clan is also highly in tune with trends and fashion, the better to prowl among and attract prey.\r\n\r\n**Havens:** Daeva havens vary, but they’re almost universally comforting... in a subtly alarming way that suggests an artificial appeal to whatever vessels a Kindred favors. Most are convenient to social or political centers. The specific aesthetics vary, but most are intended to impress any compatriots, allies or victims who might be invited in. Penthouses and condominiums are particularly popular. Many Daeva don’t bother to keep up appearances if they don’t think they’ll bring prey home, meaning that some havens are sloppy or cluttered with unsettling reminders of previous vessels’ presence.\r\n\r\n**Background:** With a growing number of exceptions, Daeva are Embraced from the ranks of society’s elite. Succubus sires look for some combination of charm, culture, seductiveness, desire to achieve, passion and physical beauty. Many Daeva Embrace mortals to whom they have become attached, but this attachment almost invariably proves false, a mixture of lust and simple hunger. Few relationships are as euphoric as those between a Daeva and a newly Embraced childe, and few grow cold as swiftly.\r\n\r\n**Character Creation:** Social Attributes and Skills are of primary concern, particularly those that aid in making good first impressions, in persuading and in seducing. Social Merits are equally common, representing the character’s connections to both mortal and Kindred society. Given that most Daeva feed almost exclusively through manipulation and betrayal, a high starting Humanity score is a good idea, since it’s likely to fall precipitously.\r\n\r\n**Favored Attributes:** Dexterity or Manipulation\r\n\r\n**Clan Disciplines:** Celerity, Majesty, Vigor\r\n\r\n**Weakness:** Perhaps out of some deep longing for the true passions they lost after the Embrace, the Daeva have difficulty steeling themselves against the hedonism they allow themselves as members of the Damned. Any time a Daeva has an opportunity to indulge her Vice but does not do so, she loses two points of Willpower (as opposed to gaining one by partaking in its pleasures).\r\n\r\n**Organization:** Status among the Daeva is entirely a social issue, and many young ones resemble squabbling cliques more so than undying creatures of the night. Not even elder Daeva are strangers to petty vendettas and long-nursed grudges. While a Succubus is likely to join with one of her own in the face of an outside threat, they compete with one another as much as they do with other Kindred, if not more so. The Daeva therefore have no true formal structure. Those who are dominant in the Danse Macabre’s social and political scene are dominant among the clan as well.\r\n\r\n**Bloodlines:** Duchagne (an aristocratic but degenerate European bloodline that seems to have the ability to directly manipulate the senses and sensations of others), Toreador (a branch of the clan that has recognized its loss of passion and tries to re-create it by inspiring mortals either to creative pursuits or extreme emotions; they invariably grow bored and move on, leaving their former wards desolate), Xiao. \r\n\r\n**Concepts:** Bored socialite, club hopper, club owner, cult leader, cultured serial killer, full-time Harpy, jaded vampire who gets off on being a creature of the night (a fairly melodramatic attitude found only among the very young before the weight of the Requiem fully settles on them), Kindred politico, local covenant spokesman, patron of the arts, professional “escort”', 'The Daeva are emotional, sensual and desirable. Sexual predators and sensual hedonists alike populate the ranks of these succubi-seducers.\r\n\r\nAmong Kindred historians, the Daeva are suspected of being one of the oldest clans of the Damned. Their moniker suggests a Persian mythological origin, and their abilities suggest that they could be related to the demons from which they take their name. A few ancient writings suggest that the progenitor of the line was a Kindred known as Aesma Daeva, but vampiric scholars debate whether this individual was actually undead or the writings merely draw comparisons to the Persian demon of lust and anger.\r\n\r\nThe name “Daeva” predates the commonly accepted origin point of Kindred society, generally understood to parallel the ascension of Rome. Certainly, some incarnation of the Daeva existed before then, but whether they had their own society or were merely a rabble of lust-crazed revenants is unknown. After the rise of Rome, the Daeva had become an inextricable part of Kindred society, and vampiric history shows that they were very active in the Camarilla, the first known social contract of the undead.', 'Emotional, sensual and desirable.'),
(2, 'Gangrel', '', 'The Gangrel are primal, hardy and savage. They embody the myths of vampires turning into animals or otherwise changing form (wolves, bats, mist).\r\n\r\nMany Kindred believe that the Gangrel clan is an old one, but due to the Gangrel’s bestial nature, few records exist that can connect their origins to any specific time period. While the murky pre-history of the Kindred contains any number of legends about bestial vampires, not all of these tales coincide with the hallmarks of the Gangrel.\r\n\r\nGeographically, the Gangrel seem to hail from what is tonight Eastern Europe, where they came in contact with the nascent Camarilla and were reluctantly drawn into that society. As Rome’s holdings moved westward, so, too did the Camarilla and thus the Gangrel. Historians also theorize strong Gangrel roots in what is modern Scandinavia. Since those early nights of society, the Gangrel have chosen the outlying borders of domains for their own territories. As such, Gangrel are often seen as pioneers, eking out an existence where domains will later form, or as scavengers, clinging desperately to territories and refusing to yield once domains have fallen.', 'Primal, hardy and savage.'),
(3, 'Mekhet', '', 'The Mekhet are quick, discreet and wise. Legends of vampires hiding in shadows, preying secretly on victims, and even learning secrets no one else but the keeper is supposed to know probably refer to Mekhet activities.\r\n\r\nSome of the oldest Kindred known to the vampiric world are members of Clan Mekhet, though most spend their time harrowed by the cold sleep known as torpor. While most are predisposed toward solitude, some have traveled with mortal armies and are even suspected of forming undead mercenary factions of their own. As with most other clans, nothing verifiable is known about the progenitor of the Mekhet line. Many stories depict reclusive Mekhet cult-leaders or masters of schools of stealthy soldiers, so the clan might have origins that abut the Pharaohs or philosopher-kings of the Classical or Ancient worlds.\r\n\r\nThe name Mekhet itself gives some clues as to the clan’s origin, as it is an Egyptian word for “amulet.” Some of the most venerable elders certainly bear features that might be described as Egyptian, while a few have classical Hellenic complexions, which isn’t surprising, considering Greece’s proximity to Egypt. The commerce between the Egyptians and Greeks, and later the Romans, corresponds with the legendary travels of members of this clan, as well as their formative role in the nascent Camarilla. Since that time, the Mekhet have traveled wherever shadows have fallen, wherever secrets lay hidden, and wherever Kindred call upon others to give them counsel.', 'Quick, discreet and wise.'),
(4, 'Nosferatu', '', 'The Nosferatu are stealthy, strong and terrifying. Their very presence unnerves people, whether by physical ugliness, foul stench or nebulous personal malignance.\r\n\r\nStudies of Nosferatu legend suggest that the clan is relatively young, possibly originating not too long before the rise of Rome, and possibly among the peoples it conquered. Certainly, the Nosferatu were active among the clans of the Camarilla, but proof of their presence before then is spotty at best. And yet, claims occasionally surface about very old Kindred who, if not Nosferatu, are strikingly *like* the Nosferatu. Whether these vampires are indeed members of the same clan, are Kindred of some “proto-clan” that became the Nosferatu, or are entirely unrelated can only be guessed at.\r\n\r\nLegends of the *nosferatu* are historically heaviest in central Europe, particularly in Germany, northern Italy and eastern France. Early records describing what seem to be broods of Nosferatu also originate in modern Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Greece, with some indication of presence in north Africa as well. Like the Gangrel, Nosferatu tend to either seek out territories before or after most of Kindred culture bothers with them. Unlike the Gangrel, though the Nosferatu adapt relatively quickly to the presence of other vampires, relying on their monstrous nature to make a place for them in the society of the Damned.', 'Stealthy, strong and terrifying.'),
(5, 'Ventrue', '', 'The Ventrue are regal, commanding and aristocratic. Vampires as everything from Eastern European lords on the mountain to gentrified nobles to modern corporate raiders belong to this clan.\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, the Ventrue are understood to be the youngest of the clans, almost certainly originating in Rome itself, probably in tandem with the formation of the Camarilla. While their history is relatively short (in vampiric terms), it is also distinguished, as the Ventrue are made to rule. Although none remember the name of the first Ventrue, various vampiric histories do ascribe the origin of the clan, which was believed to once be a covenant, to a single female vampire. A darker history implies that this Kindred was not the first of the Ventrue line, but that she consumed the soul of her own sire, and in so doing founded a new bloodline that rose to the status of a proper clan.\r\n\r\nAs might be surmised, the Ventrue have historically been strongest in Europe, from which they grew into North and Central America, but their presence elsewhere in the world has been relatively minor. As a clan, their numbers are probably fewer than those of any other clan, but such things vary by domain, as one vampire community might consist of nothing but Ventrue — likely all the preeminent Kindred’s progeny.', 'Regal, commanding and aristocratic.');

(1, 'Animalism', 'They can not only commune with lower creatures, but project their will upon them, forcing them to obey.\r\n\r\nAs the Kindred gain power, some develop the ability to join with animals, or to influence the Beast lurking with their own souls or the souls of other vampires.\r\n\r\nMost Kindred are **repellent to animals**. Lesser creatures grow agitated in the presence of the undead and normally flee the scene (or, in some cases, attack the vampire in question). Kindred who possess Animalism are a very different story. Animals are often attracted to such Kindred, and **their presence is soothing** even to restless beasts.\r\n\r\nOther sentient, supernatural beings such as shapechangers who have animal form or who can assume animal form are **not** affected by **Animalism**. Their intelligence makes them the purview of the Dominate Discipline. Similarly, Animalism is **useless** on another vampire who assumes wolf or another bestial form. Animalism is of no avail to the vampire in regard to such intelligent beings.\r\n\r\nNote that any Animalism power that requires eye contact is made **more difficult if the subject does not stand still** or is not otherwise immobilized. If the animal in question moves about, the roll to initiate the relevant power suffers a **-1 penalty** in addition to all others listed.', 'Although most look human, all the Kindred conceal within them a feral predator, a Beast that divides all others into only two categories: threat or prey.\r\n\r\nSome Kindred feel their affinity with the animals of the world, and their connection with their own animalistic nature to a greater degree than others.\r\n\r\nThese Kindred often develop the Discipline of Animalism, which allows them to bond with the beasts — and the Beasts— around them.', 0),
(2, 'Auspex', 'Auspex can be used to pierce the veil of powers that cloud, dissemble and deceive (see Clash of Wills). Indeed, precious little can be kept secret from a true master of Auspex.\r\n\r\nOnce in a while, this uncanny Discipline provides extrasensory and even precognitive visitations. Such premonitions might come as quick flashes of imagery, overwhelming feelings of empathy or even as an ominous sense of foreboding. The Kindred has absolutely no control over these insights, but he can learn to interpret their significance given time and experience.\r\n\r\nSuch potent sensitivity can have its drawbacks, however. When a vampire actively uses any level of Auspex save the fifth (Twilight Projection), he runs the risk of his delicate senses being overwhelmed by excessive stimuli. Sudden or severe occurrences such as a gun report or flash bulb in the eyes can distract the character unless the player succeeds on a **Resolve roll**.\r\nFailure disorients the character, making him effectively **unaware of his surroundings until the end of the following turn**.', 'This potent Discipline grants a character superlative sensory capabilities. At the lowest levels, it sharpens a Kindred’s mundane senses. As one progresses in mastery, entirely new avenues of insight open up before the user. Ultimately, this is the Discipline of gleaning information, whether that data comes from sights and smells, from auras and patterns of energy or directly from the mind of another creature.', 1),
(3, 'Celerity', NULL, 'Tales and legends of vampires ascribe to them inhuman speed, the ability to move faster than the eye can see, and even to appear in two places at once. While some of those accounts are exaggerated, Kindred with the Discipline of Celerity can indeed move far faster than any mortal. They appear to blur into nothingness, all others moving as if in slow motion in comparison.\r\n', 0),
(4, 'Dominate', 'Use of Dominate requires a character to capture a victim’s gaze. The Discipline can therefore be used on only one subject at a time, and is **useless if eye contact is not possible**.\r\n \r\nDominate does not grant the ability to make oneself understood or to communicate mentally. Commands must be issued verbally, though certain simple commands (such as “Go over there!” indicated with a pointed finger and a forceful expression) may be conveyed by signs at the Storyteller’s discretion.\r\nNo matter how powerful a vampire is, **she cannot force her victim to obey if she cannot make herself understood** — if, for example, the victim doesn’t speak the same language, she cannot hear or the orders simply make no sense.\r\n \r\nNote that victims of Dominate **might realize** what’s been done to them. That is, they do not automatically sense that they are being controlled, but they might subsequently wonder why they suddenly acted as they did. Wise Kindred, especially those familiar with Dominate, are likely to figure it out in the moment, and few vampires take kindly to being manipulated in such a fashion.\r\n Most Kindred who develop Dominate are forceful, controlling personalities, and they can make a reputation for themselves if they use this Discipline wantonly.\r\n \r\nIn all cases, a dramatic failure while attempting to Dominate a victim renders the would-be victim **immune to the character’s Dominate until the next sunset**.\r\n \r\nDominate is far more effective against mortals than it is against other Kindred. Most Dominate abilities described here allow the victim to struggle against the effects; that is, a contested roll is made against the Dominator’s player. As no mortal has Blood Potency, the vast majority of humans are at a disadvantage when dealing with the Discipline.\r\n \r\nDominate is also more effective against those whom the user has subjected to a Vinculum. A regnant may use Dominate powers (with the exception of Conditioning) on a thrall **without the need for eye contact**; the thrall merely has to hear the regnant’s voice.\r\n \r\nOther sentient, supernatural beings such as shapechangers who have animal form or who can assume animal form are affected by Dominate rather than by Animalism. A vampire can therefore try to ply his will on a werewolf — even a werewolf in wolf form — by using Dominate.\r\nSimilarly, Animalism is useless against another vampire who assumes wolf or another bestial form. Animalism is of no avail to the vampire in regard to such intelligent beings.\r\n \r\nNote that any Dominate power requiring eye contact is made more difficult if the subject is not standing still or otherwise immobilized. If the target moves about, the roll to initiate the relevant power suffers a **-1 penalty** in addition to all others listed.', 'Some Kindred are capable of overwhelming the minds of others with their own force of will, influencing actions and even thoughts.', 1),
(5, 'Majesty', 'Unlike some other Disciplines, Majesty can be used on entire crowds of targets simultaneously, making it even more potent— in the right hands.\r\n \r\nThe only requirement for use of most Majesty powers is that **any potential targets see the character**. Eye contact is not required, nor is the ability to hear the character (though it certainly doesn’t hurt).\r\n \r\nThe downside to Majesty, such as is it is, is that its subjects retain their free will. Unlike victims of Dominate, who follow the commands of the Kindred nearly mindlessly, those acting under Majesty are simply emotionally predisposed to do whatever the power (or its user) suggests.\r\nWhile retention of personality makes victims more useful in the long run, it also means they require more care in handling than targets of Dominate. An abused victim of Majesty certainly subverts or represses what his emotions suggest in order to behave in the most appropriate manner. Meanwhile, subjects treated well might be persuaded to act against even their own interests.\r\n \r\nAny mortal can resist Majesty for one turn if a Willpower point is spent and a successful Composure roll is made (though the Willpower point does not add three dice to the roll). This roll is reflexive. If the roll fails, the Willpower point is lost and the target remains under the effects of the power(s). If the roll is successful, the mortal probably spends his turn of “freedom” fleeing the vampire’s proximity, lest he continue to be affected. Refusing to pay attention to the vampire, rather than fleeing, can allow a mortal to resist the spell for a turn, but the power resumes effect if the mortal remains in the Kindred’s vicinity.\r\n \r\nVampires resist Majesty in much the same way (by spending a Willpower point), but Blood Potency is added to Composure rolls made for them.\r\nIn addition, **vampires of higher Blood Potency than the character invoking Majesty are able to resist his power for the entire scene** with the expenditure of one Willpower point and a successful Composure + Blood Potency roll.\r\n \r\nBy and large, the Kindred who choose to develop their Majesty abilities are those who recognize that one achieves more with honey than with vinegar. Those who swear by Majesty often find Dominate, seen as “the flip side of Majesty,” to be both boorish and crass, and they would swear to calling upon it only in times of dire need.', 'One of the most legendary powers of the undead is the ability to attract, sway and control the emotions of others, especially those of mortals. Majesty is perhaps the most versatile of Disciplines, for its potential uses and applications are both varied and multitudinous. The more savvy the practitioner, the more use he can get out of each of the Discipline’s levels.', 1),
(6, 'Nightmare', 'Vampires who delve into the dark side of their being —often exploring the Beast or what it means to be monstrous— invest in the Discipline of Nightmare. They learn to bear that which is terrifying or unholy about their spirits, manifesting their inhumanity in their appearance or letting unfortunate onlookers peer deep into the creatures’ depraved souls.\r\n\r\nThe results can take a jaded individual aback or subject an unsuspecting victim to a fatal physiological reaction (to literally be frightened to death).\r\n\r\nPractitioners of Nightmare explore this route to power for different reasons. One vampire might exult in his inhuman nature and enjoy lording over lessers. The Discipline offers immediate gratification, and these Kindred display what is hideous about themselves to everyone, hiding it only insofar as they must in order to observe the secrecy of the Traditions. Other undead recognize the wisdom or even benevolence that fear affords. What better way to deal with a problem or avoid a confrontation than by frightening away an opponent? How better to protect someone from harm than by scaring her off? And if one seeks solitude, striking fear is certainly more effective than issuing threats, trying to reason with would-be intruders or orchestrating ever more elaborate means by which to hide.\r\n\r\nAll uses of Nightmare gain a +2 bonus if the individual power is turned on a vampire with whom the user has a Blood Tie. Naturally, this bonus does not apply to the subject’s resistance.', 'There’s no question that one of the foremost powers of legendary vampires is the ability to strike fear in the hearts of mortal men. Also born of mortal existence, other now-supernatural beings are susceptible. Fear is a fact of existence that transcends any origins.\r\n', 1),
(7, 'Obfuscate', 'Obfuscate clouds the mind in practice. For example, a character hiding an object by using this Discipline doesn’t actually make the object disappear, nor does someone using the Discipline to hide himself truly vanish. Rather, the mind sees “around” the Obfuscated object, refusing to acknowledge it, even if that requires a bit of filling in mental blanks. To continue the example, if a character Obfuscated a large sheet of plywood and tried to hide behind it herself, those looking at the plywood would, indeed, see the character lurking behind it but not see the plywood itself.\r\n\r\nThe shroud of Obfuscate is very difficult to penetrate. Few Kindred or other supernatural creatures can see through it, and only under the rarest of circumstances do mortals have any hope. Because they operate on a less conscious and mostly instinctual level, however, animals often perceive a vampire’s presence — and react with appropriate fear or hostility — even if they cannot detect him with their normal senses. Similarly, children, the mentally ill and others who see the world in ways not quite normal might pierce the deception at the Storyteller’s discretion.\r\n\r\nSome Kindred with Auspex are able to see through Obfuscate, or at least sense the presence of a supernatural deception. Refer to the “Clash of Wills” for details.\r\n\r\nIt’s important to note that Obfuscate affects the viewer’s mind, rather than making any true physical change to the vampire. Thus, the Discipline is not effective at cloaking a character from mechanical devices. Photographs, video cameras and the like record the normal blurred image that all vampires leave in such media, not the assumed appearance.\r\n\r\nObfuscate does affect any individual currently using the recording device, however, so someone videotaping an Obfuscated vampire sees the illusion when looking through the lens, discovering the truth only later when he reviews the tape itself.\r\n\r\nUnless stated otherwise, Obfuscate powers require very little concentration to maintain once invoked, and they last for the duration of a scene.', 'Night-dwellers, predators by nature and keepers of the Masquerade, vampires are inherently (and necessarily) creatures of secrecy and stealth. From hiding minute objects to the ability to appear as someone else to the power to fade from sight entirely, the Discipline of Obfuscate grants the Kindred uncanny powers of concealment, stealth and deception.', 0),
(8, 'Protean', 'Since the core of a vampire’s self doesn’t alter with his shape, a transformed Kindred can generally take any action or use any Discipline that his new form can reasonably allow. Gangrel in the form of a cloud of mist, for example, could read auras (as the sense of sight doesn’t vanish), but couldn’t Dominate someone effectively (as the prerequisite eye contact can no longer be established). A vampire’s clothes and personal effects change shape with him, but he cannot normally transmute especially large objects or other creatures.\r\n\r\nUnless stated otherwise, Protean powers — being permanent physical changes — last as long as the vampire wishes them to, or until he is forced into torpor. Any state that prevents the character from taking action (such as being staked) likewise prevents transformation; the vampire needs the freedom to invoke his will.', 'Easily one of the most overtly spectacular of the gifts of the Damned, the Discipline of Protean is the study of physical metamorphosis and transformation. The nature of this power is hotly debated among the Kindred, for its abilities are so varied while simultaneously stemming from no obvious aspect of the Curse. Whatever its cause or origin, Protean allows its masters to assume virtually any form or shape.', 1),
(9, 'Resilience', NULL, 'Legends abound of vampires who are able to withstand even the most brutal punishment to their unliving forms. While all Kindred possess a certain degree of the toughness of which these tales speak, those with the Discipline of Resilience are commensurately more stalwart. Vampires with several dots of Resilience are capable of walking through a hail of bullets, shrugging off even the most punishing blows, and even resisting the deadly claws and fangs of supernatural foes.', 0),
(10, 'Vigor', NULL, 'Nearly every vampire legend across the globe expresses the preternatural strength possessed by the undead. In truth, not all Kindred possess such inhuman might, but the Discipline of Vigor makes those who do far more powerful than any mortal could ever hope to be. Vigor allows Kindred to strike opponents with the force of a falling boulder or speeding car; to lift enormous weights as though they were paper; to shatter concrete like glass; to leap distances so great that those elders with obscenely high levels of Vigor may, in fact, be responsible for legends of vampiric flight.', 0);

(4, 'Subsume the Lesser Spirit', 4, 1, 8, 17, '>By locking eyes with an animal, a vampire may psychically enter the creature’s body and possess it as though it were his own. Some Kindred believe that doing so actually transfers the vampire’s soul into the beast, though other, less mystically minded Kindred disagree. Regardless, the animal’s own mind and instincts are completely subsumed, allowing the Kindred free reign to take whatever action she chooses in the creature’s body. \r\n>\r\n>The vampire’s own body falls into a torpor-like state and appears for all intents and purposes to be a corpse. Until the character returns, his body cannot be awakened by any means (though Kindred urban legends tell of ghosts possessing such bodies and wreaking havoc). Also, it is whispered among certain circles that some vampires, addicted to the sensations of life they experience while riding an animal, remain too long in that form and forget their true nature.\r\n\r\n**Rank:** ••••\\\r\n**Action:** Contested\\\r\n**Cost:** 1 Vitae\\\r\n**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Animal Ken + Animalism versus animal’s Composure\r\n \r\n**Roll Results**\\\r\n**Success:** The character wins the contested action and occupies the animal’s body.

If the character doesn’t indulge in animalistic activity, the Storyteller should feel free to either dock the character future experience points or spend Willpower automatically for the character when a particularly bestial response is appropriate but not displayed.\r\n\r\nWhile possessing an animal, a character can travel as far from his own body as he wishes and is unharmed by daylight, but he must still force himself to stay awake during the day. The vampire may choose to end the possession and return to his body at any time, regardless of distance. This occurs automatically if the vampire fails to remain awake. Any injuries inflicted on the animal also affect the vampire’s body. If the animal dies while the vampire is still present, the Kindred falls into torpor immediately.(Some believe that the soul attempts to find its way back to its own body during this time.)\r\n\r\nIf the Kindred’s physical form is destroyed, his psyche remains trapped in the animal until he finally fails to remain awake, at which point his spirit is lost to oblivion and is unrecoverable.\r\n\r\nIt is possible, though uncommon, for a vampire to neglect his physical body long enough for it to starve into torpor while he’s “out.” If a vampire’s dormant body slips or is forced into torpor, the vampire’s spirit automatically returns to its body.'),

Frenzy or Rötschreck rules apply as normal for the remainder of the scene if either is induced.\\\r\n**Exceptional Success:** The character fulfills the instant action or wins the contested roll with five or more successes, and the subject is immediately forced into (or out of) frenzy or Rötschreck. If the subject is forced into frenzy or Rötschreck, he or she remains in that state for the remainder of the scene, regardless of surrounding events or circumstances. Additionally, Willpower cannot be spent to end the frenzy prematurely. If the subject is brought out of frenzy or Rötschreck, he or she is not subject to frenzy or Rötschreck for the remainder of the scene, regardless of surrounding events or circumstances.\\\r\n**Failure:** The character fails the instant action, or loses or ties the contested action and the power fails.\\\r\n**Dramatic Failure**(oneself): The opposite kind of frenzy sought is invoked (Rötschreck when rage frenzy was intended).\\\r\n**Dramatic Failure**(another): The character’s power rebounds and a Willpower point must be spent or she enters either frenzy or Rötschreck, whichever she attempted to influence. Additionally, the subject is immune to any further **Leashing the Beast** attempts by the character until the next sunset.\r\n\r\nThis is not overt control, as with [[#Obedience|Obedience]] or the [[Dominate]] Discipline. Rather, the Kindred learns to rouse the Beast’s instincts, inspiring it — and thus the vampire within whom it lurks — to behave in a certain manner.\\\r\nOf course, communing with the Beast is dangerous even under the best of circumstances, and a few unfortunate Kindred have been destroyed by their own failed attempts to manipulate others’ Beasts.\r\n\r\nThe subject must be a vampire and must be within the character’s line of sight. (If the character makes herself the subject, she need not be able to see, so she can do so even in complete darkness or when otherwise blinded.)

(7, 'Aura Perception', 2, 2, 1, 18, '>With this mystic power, a vampire can open his perceptions to the psychic auras that surround all sentient creatures. Numerous and often-shifting hues and patterns compose these auras, and it can take many years before a vampire becomes truly proficient at reading them correctly with any degree of regularity. Although the strongest emotions predominate, almost every individual has more than one color to his aura at any given time, and an observer can see any number of streaks or flashes of these other colors.\r\n\r\n**Rank**: ••\\\r\n**Action**: Instant +2 full turns (Though this is an instant action, it takes more than just a fleeting glance to see the detail in an aura. A character must scrutinize her subject’s aura for two full turns to glean information from it, though only the single, immediate roll is necessary to determine if she can read it successfully.)\\\r\n**Cost**: —\\\r\n**Dice Pool**: Intelligence + Empathy + Auspex – subject’s Composure\\\r\n**Special**: The degree of information provided by **Aura Perception** depends on the number of dices removed from the pool.\r\n \r\n**Roll Results**\\\r\n**Success**: The character perceives a number of colors in the subject’s aura equal to the number of successes obtained on the roll.\\\r\n**Exceptional Success**: As per a normal success, with one additional color or degree of emotional intensity discernible to the character.\\\r\n**Failure**: The character can distinguish no information at all.\\\r\n**Dramatic Failure**: The character gleans utterly misleading and wholly inaccurate information.\r\n\r\nNote that a failure indicates that no useful information is perceived, while a dramatic failure indicates a false or misleading reading.\\\r\nThe Storyteller may therefore wish to make the roll for the player, to keep the true results secret.\r\n\r\n“Psychic colors” change with the subject’s mental or emotional state, creating an ever-moving pattern that is as unique to each person as a fingerprint. As a rule, the more powerful the emotions, the more intense the colors, but even this guideline is betrayed by any number of mitigating factors, depending on circumstance. All the same, practice makes perfect; a true master aura-perceiver learns to understand the significance of each whorl and eddy.\r\n\r\nDue to the peculiar nature of such creatures’ auras, this power can be used as a means of detecting other supernatural entities. Vampire auras, for example, tend to be extremely pale, regardless of the colors. Werewolf auras are quite the contrary, nearly frantic in their intensity. Mage auras sparkle with power. Ghostly auras flicker like guttering candles.\r\n\r\nAn Auspex user who observes someone in the act of lying may recognize that the subject speaks falsely. Intelligence + Empathy + Auspex is rolled versus the subject’s Composure in a contested action. The Auspex user recognizes the lie if the most successes are rolled for him.\r\n\r\nApplied toward reading the mood of potential combatants, this power also grants its user a bonus to Initiative equal to the number of successes rolled in activating the effect. Doing so requires that the vampire speaks to or is in the proximity of intended combatants for at least one turn before a fight breaks out. That period of interaction allows the reading vampire to recognize that events are about to turn violent, so he can react with advanced knowledge.'),

The vampire therefore gets Celerity’s protection bonus early in the turn. Celerity’s Initiative bonus is also added immediately in the turn, potentially moving the vampire’s action before her attacker’s in the Initiative roster. The vampire also gains the benefit of additional Speed for the turn. If one Vitae is spent to keep Celerity active into the next turn, all of these benefits carry over.\r\n\r\nNote that Celerity is obviously superhuman in use. Few Princes smile upon uses of Celerity that leave too many curious mortal witnesses unaccounted for.\r\n\r\nCelerity cannot be invoked more than once per turn. That is, you may not spend a second Vitae and double the benefits of Celerity in a given turn, though you may spend Vitae across multiple turns to enjoy the benefits over those turns.\r\n\r\nIn turns when a character activates her Celerity, her dots in the Discipline are subtracted from any and all attacking characters’ dice pools, as the vampire moves much more quickly than normal and is harder to hit. This penalty to attackers’ pools applies in addition to any armor the Celerity-using character may have, as well as to Defense (though note, like armor, Celerity’s benefits do not diminish based on how many attacks the character faces). Celerity’s protection even applies against firearms.\r\n\r\nFor example, if a character has Celerity 3 and activates the Discipline, three dice are subtracted from any assailants’ dice pools.\r\n\r\nCelerity also adds to a character’s Initiative during the turnin which it is active. The aforementioned character with Celerity 3 and Initiative 5 would have a basic Initiative modifier of 8 during turns in which his Celerity is active.\r\n\r\nFinally, Celerity acts as a modifier to a character’s Speed while it is active. His Speed increases by itself again for each dot of Celerity he possesses. (Simply add one to the value of the character’s Celerity and multiply that number by his Speed.)\r\nCharacters running while Celerity is active double this figure, as well.\r\n\r\nIf a vampire doesn’t activate Celerity until his stage of the Initiative roster in a turn, previous actions taken by others that turn aren’t invalidated. (They aren’t re-done because the vampire suddenly has a higher standing in the roster.) By activating Celerity “late” in the turn, the vampire forfeits his Initiative bonus that turn. The vampire also gains Celerity’s protection only against attacks that come after his place in the Initiative roster for the turn. If Celerity is kept active into the next turn, the vampire’s Initiative bonus and full protection applies throughout.'),

Personal safety always takes precedence, and any commotion pulls even the most rapt listener from his reverie of attention. Those subjected to the character’s stature likely remember how good they felt around him, and tailor future reactions accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe number of successes the player acquires is compared to the Composure of each intended subject.\r\n* If the number of successes exceeds a given target’s Composure, that subject is affected by the character’s powerful personality.\r\n* If a subject’s Composure is equal to or higher than the number of successes earned, that subject goes unaffected.\r\n\r\nA character may Awe whomever is present (see the suggested modifiers below), and comparisons are made from lowest Composure to highest among potential subjects.

Each acquisition of this Merit is dedicated to one type of ally, whether in an organization, society or circle. Examples include the police, City Hall, criminals, unions, banks, university faculty and hospital staff. In order to have alliances in more than one venue, you need to purchase this Merit multiple times, each trait with its own dots.\n\nThus, your character might have Allies (Police) ••, Allies (Criminals) ••• and Allies (City Hall) •, each acquired separately at character creation or during play. Each dot that your character has indicates how deep his influence runs in that group. One dot might mean he can ask for minor favors, such as being spared a parking ticket if alliance is among police, or being allowed to see an article before it goes to press if alliance is among reporters. Three dots garner considerable favors, such as a building permit “going missing” at City Hall, or a strike resolution being wrapped up early among union leaders. Five dots allow for dangerous and even overtly criminal favors, such as a stock being sabotaged on Wall Street or the answers to an exam being shared by a university professor.\n\nThe kinds of requests made of people in an organization typically have to relate to their sphere of influence. Asking a criminal to slow down the bureaucratic process at City Hall makes no sense, but asking him to pass along word of a drug buy does. Favors might be minor and within the bounds of a person’s job or role, such as processing some paperwork more quickly than usual, or could be significant or dangerous and outside what’s allowed or even legal, such as allowing a civilian access to the police evidence locker.\n\nThe Storyteller has final say over what is an acceptable request and what is not. If there’s any doubt, the Storyteller could call for a Manipulation + Persuasion roll, with a bonus equal to your character’s Allies dots. Penalties might also apply based on the importance or danger of the request. Asking someone to do something already in the bounds of their role imposes no modifier, while asking them to do something that could get them suspended imposes a -3 penalty, and asking for something that could get them jailed or killed is -5. Frequent favors asked of the same group also imposes a penalty as group members grow tired of being called upon.\n\nSimilarly, a roll of Manipulation + Persuasion + Allies dots could determine how many police answer your character’s call for help, or how many longshoremen turn up when your character needs a show of force (one per success rolled).\n\nAllies doesn’t have to be defined in terms of specific individuals over whom your character has sway.

Contacts is strictly information-gathering. Contacts do not come perform services for your character or rush to his aid.

Exceeding the confines of authority or proper channels transcends the limits of the Status Merit. Going above and beyond — to ask for favors rather than give orders or to requisition an official request — enters the realm of the Allies Merit. So, a police detective who gets a lower-ranking officer to investigate a case may do so with Status. That request is conducted through proper channels. Meanwhile, a police detective who asks another officer to overlook some evidence or to delay an investigation does so with Allies.

(42, 'Haven', 'social', 0, 1, 1, 5, 0, 0, NULL, 'A haven is a place where a vampire sleeps, protected from the sun during the deadly daylight hours. Legends tell of vampires in dark, twisted citadels on high mountain peaks, complete with labyrinthine catacombs, but the reality is far less grandiose. In truth, a haven can be as simple as a sewer or an abandoned warehouse or a crate in a forgotten storage closet, as long as it is undisturbed between dawn and dusk.\r\n\r\nAll havens are not created equal. A warehouse might have plenty of space and proximity to a significant amount of prey, but it might not be secure against unwanted visitors. An abandoned subway car in a long-forgotten tunnel has space and adequate security, but it might be so far out of the way that finding prey is difficult. Great time and effort is spent finding suitable havens, and their value is represented by three factors — location, size and security. Players who choose this Merit must also choose how to allocate these three factors when spending points. For instance, two points may be spent on Haven Location, with a third spent on Haven Security.\r\n\r\nA good Haven Location makes it easier for a vampire to feed, situated near a meeting place for large numbers of humans. A haven with many dots in this category might be close to several nightclubs or bars that do considerable nighttime business, while one with few dots might simply be close to a bus or train station that brings travelers on a regular basis. Each dot of Haven Location grants a +1 die bonus on hunting checks for the character who controls it and any whom she allows in. Havens without any dots in Location are sufficiently secluded so as to not provide any bonus. Haven Size is important to characters who need a place to safely store their possessions and valuables. A haven with no dots in Haven Size is just large enough for its owner and perhaps a single companion, with minimal if any storage capacity — the aforementioned crate in the forgotten storage closet, or a cramped apartment. By spending points to increase a haven’s size, a player allows for accoutrements and personal effects. Larger havens can be anything from mansions to mountain hideaways to vast subterranean catacombs. Note, however, that havens of considerable size are not necessarily easy to maintain.\r\n\r\n• A small apartment or underground chamber; 1-2 rooms\\\r\n•• A large apartment or small family home; 3-4 rooms\\\r\n••• A warehouse, church or large home; 5-8 rooms, or large enclosure\\\r\n•••• A abandoned mansion or network of subway tunnels; equivalent of 9-15 rooms or chambers\\\r\n••••• A sprawling estate or vast network of tunnels; countless rooms or chambers\\\r\n\r\nOf course, Haven Location and Haven Size do not prevent rival vampires from attempting to find and steal choice havens, nor do they prevent intrusion by mortals (police, criminal organizations, social workers). Players of characters who wish to ensure privacy and safety may choose to spend points on Haven Security, thus making it difficult for others to gain entrance. Havens with no dots in Haven Security can be found by those intent enough to look, and offer little protection once they have been breached. Each dot of Haven Security subtracts one die from efforts to intrude into the haven by anyone a character doesn’t specifically allow in. This increased difficulty may be because the entrance is so difficult to locate (behind a bookcase, under a carpet) or simply difficult to penetrate (behind a vault door). Also, each dot of Haven Security offers a +1 bonus on Initiative for those inside against anyone attempting to gain entrance (good sight lines, video surveillance).\r\n\r\nCharacters whose players spend no points at all on Haven might have their own small, humble havens, or perhaps they share the haven of a sire or Prince. In any event, they simply do not gain the mechanical benefits of those who have spent Merit points improving the quality of their homes. Each aspect of the Haven Merit has a limit of 5. In other words, Haven Location, Haven Size and Haven Security may not rise above 5 (to a maximum of 15 points spent on this Merit).\r\n\r\nSpecial: It’s possible for the Haven Merit to be shared among characters in a close-knit group. They might simply be devoted to one another and willing to pool what they have, or perhaps their mutual reliance on an individual or trust could bring them together to share what they have in common. To share this Merit, two or more characters simply have to be willing to pool their dots for greater capability. A shared rating in the Haven Merit cannot rise higher than five dots in any of the three aspects of the trait. That is, characters cannot pool more than five points to be devoted to, say, Haven Size. If they wish to devote extra points to the Merit, they must allocate those dots to a different aspect of the Merit, such as Location or Security.\r\n\r\nShared Haven dots can be lost. Coterie members or associates might be abused or mistreated, ending relationships. Group members might perform actions that cast themselves (and the group) in a bad light. Money might be spent or lost. If any group member does something to diminish the haven, its dots decrease for all group members. That’s the weakness of sharing dots in this Merit. The chain is only as strong as its weakest link. The Storyteller dictates when character actions or events in a story compromise shared Haven dots.\r\n\r\nCharacters can also leave a shared haven. A rift might form between close Kindred. A character might meet Final Death. Or one could be kicked out of the haven by the others. When a character leaves a shared-Haven relationship, the dots he contributed are removed from the pool. If the individual still survives, he doesn’t get all his dots back for his own purposes. He gets one less than he originally contributed. So, if a character breaks a relationship with his coterie, his two Haven dots are lost by the group, but he gets only one dot back for his own purposes. The lost dot represents the cost or bad image that comes from the breakup. If all members agree to part ways, they all lose one dot from what they originally contributed.\r\n\r\nThe Storyteller decides what reduced dots mean in the story when a character leaves a shared haven. Perhaps no one else picks up the character’s attention to Haven Security, leaving that to drop. The haven might not be tended as fastidiously, causing a drop in the Haven Location value. Maybe a portion of the haven falls into disuse or even collapses, causing an effective drop in Haven Size. Whatever the case, a plausible explanation must be determined.\r\n\r\nA character need not devote all of her Haven dots to the shared Haven Merit, of course. A Kindred might maintain a separate haven of her own outside the communal one represented by the shared trait. Any leftover dots that a character has (or is unwilling to share) signify what she has to draw upon as an individual, separate from her partners. For example, three characters share a haven and expend a group total of five dots. One character chooses to use two other dots on a private haven for herself. Those remaining two dots represent a haven entirely separate from what she and her partners have established together.\r\n\r\nTo record a shared Haven Merit on your character sheet, put an asterisk next to the name of the Haven Merit and fill in the total dots that your character has access to thanks to his partnership. In order to record his original contribution, write it in parentheses along with the Merit’s name. It is not important to note which aspect of the Haven Merit on which those points are spent, as this allows greater flexibility should a character ever decide to withdraw from the community arrangement.', 'Place secured from the sun', 'VtR 100', 'vampire'),

(Enterprising Storytellers may come up with additional types of Status, and clever players might have unique applications as well. Status is designed as a sort of “umbrella” Merit, under which new types can be created.)\r\n\r\nCity Status represents a vested responsibility and according acknowledgement in the affairs of a domain. Regardless of clan and covenant, certain individuals rise to the top of the social or feudal strata, exemplary because of their efforts in the name of the domain as a whole. Princes, Regents, Primogen, Harpies and other “officers” of a given domain fit this description.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, City Status represents those Kindred who aren’t part of the prevailing social structure, but who nonetheless have significant esteem, sway or reputation among the Kindred. Examples include bosses of powerful gangs, Kindred who have considerable influence in specialized areas (prominent businessmen, city government, health care and hospitals, religious communities), or even just those who are powerful in their own right but largely apolitical, as with a potent elder who abstains from city responsibilities but whose territory is respected by all other local Kindred.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, City Status is very much a chicken-and-egg situation — does Prince Maxwell have City Status 5 because he’s Prince, or did his accumulated City Status result in his claiming praxis? In other cases, City Status obviously reflects accomplishment, as with a political activist who has many mortal supporters — but those supporters obviously didn’t join his cause because they knew he was a vampire. Harpies, in particular, make much of these distinctions, but some speculate that that’s because their own Status falls under the definition of City Status.\r\n\r\n• Hound or “rising star”\\\r\n•• Sheriff or “accomplished individual”\\\r\n••• Harpy, Seneschal, Master of Elysium or “much-deserved reputation”\\\r\n•••• Regent, Primogen, Herald or “cornerstone of Kindred society”\\\r\n••••• Prince or “true paragon”\r\n\r\nClan Status is concerned with lineage and the Blood. At the outset of a chronicle, a Kindred’s standing often reflects the prestige her sire has gained and passed along, such as with regard to the Ventrue. Many assume that childer who were Embraced by powerful and influential members of the clan have already shown some special quality or excellence, otherwise they would not have been chosen by so great a sire. This kind of recognition is short lived, however. A neonate might enjoy prestige by association under the purview of her sire, but such a favored childe is expected to make a name for herself.\r\n\r\nVampires who truly embody the ideals of their clan and who establish themselves in positions of power and influence (often as Prisci) gain the respect of others in their clan, being perceived as models for success. While the Daeva tell tales of particularly vicious Harpies of distant cities, the Gangrel speak of brooding hulks who confidently brave the Lupine-infested wilds alone. Those who diverge from the expected behavior of the clan in remarkable ways gain renown (or notoriety), as well, perhaps founding bloodlines that become known to vampire society as a whole.\r\n\r\nClan Status is not so rigidly defined as City Status. While individual clan titles might arise, the notion of esteem is more general in this context.\r\n\r\nCovenant Status represents rank, achievement and responsibility, less concerned with clan ideals and more with covenant actions, philosophies and accomplishments. The various covenants are not bound by any supernatural means or governed by clan lineage. They find a commonality of goals and ideologies, instead. It is not enough to be powerful or exemplary of clan ideals; a covenant is concerned with what its members have done to benefit its cause and combat its rivals.\r\n\r\nThose Kindred who enjoy the greatest covenant-based esteem are often the core members of their factions in a given city, those around whom others rally. These Kindred instigate or mediate conflict with other covenants, generally looking to further certain idealistic goals and establish themselves or other members in positions of influence in the local hierarchy. A Mekhet in command of a massive spy network might have status within his clan, but the lowliest of his spies might risk her unlife to gather a specific piece of information that helps oust the Invictus Prince, subsequently enjoying far more status with, say, the Ordo Dracul than her master.\r\n\r\nA character must have at least a single dot of Covenant Status in order to gain the benefits of any special abilities of that covenant. In other words, a character must have at least one dot of Covenant Status (Lancea Sanctum) in order to learn Theban Sorcery. Or a character must have at least one dot of Covenant Status (Invictus) to take advantage of the experience-point break on the Herd, Mentor, Resources and Retainer Merits. If a character leaves a covenant after learning some of its secrets, he does not lose any of those traits for which he paid experience points, but he may not learn additional dots of those traits (or additional dots at that particular price break, as with the Invictus and the Carthians). See p. 91-92 for the complete list of which covenants grant which benefits.\r\n\r\nLike Clan Status, Covenant Status is not so specifically tied to certain titles. It is more a notion of an individual’s accomplishments. A Lancea Sanctum Priest, for example, has a greater title than, say, a noted ethicist of the covenant, but that ethicist might have written numerous treatises on the state of undeath and the soul, according her more esteem among her peers than the Priest who rides solely on the weight of her title.\r\n\r\n• The character is known to a select subset of the clan/covenant — a spy network, perhaps.\r\n•• The majority of the clan/covenant in the city recognizes the character’s face and can recall her exploits.\r\n••• The character’s deeds are known to all in the local covenant, even in other nearby cities; many members of other covenants recognize her face.\r\n•••• Word of the character’s exploits has traveled far, and her name is known in cities around the country.\r\n••••• The character’s name and face are synonymous with her clan/covenant; her exploits are taught to new members of the clan/covenant.\r\n\r\nStatus can serve as a mixed blessing, however. Those who enjoy the most might be able to use it to their advantage, but they are also visible targets for their enemies. High levels of Status make it almost impossible to pass unnoticed, even while they open doors that would otherwise remain closed.\r\n\r\nStatus works like a “social tool” in that it adds to dice pools for social interactions between members of the sub-group in question. That is, Covenant Status adds to dice pools for interactions with members of the same covenant, Clan Status enhances interactions with members of the same Clan, and City Status affects those who are recognized residents of the given domain. City Status, however, may be ignored by those who are among the unbound.\r\n\r\n**Example:** Loki wants access to the Mekhet Priscus, but the Priscus is already occupied with an envoy from Clan Daeva. He instead finds himself dealing with one of her aides, another Mekhet. Loki, a Mekhet himself, tries to convince the aide that he has important business to discuss with the Priscus. His player adds Clan Status to a Manipulation + Persuasion dice pool. Loki has Manipulation 2, Persuasion 3 and Clan Status (Mekhet) 2, creating a pool of seven dice for the task.\r\n\r\nStatus does not add to dice pools predicated on supernatural powers. For example, a Prince’s City Status is not added to a dice pool for use of his Dread Gaze power. Dealing with Status can be a mire of responsibility, though clever characters can turn it to their advantage. They may actually have a variety of Status — it is not unheard of for a character to have City Status, Clan Status and Covenant Status. A character may have Clan Status only as a member of his own clan. For instance, a Nosferatu never gains Clan Status (Gangrel) no matter how much aid he provides the Savages. His aid of the Gangrel may certainly earn him esteem, but such concern is better handled on a case-by-case basis by the Storyteller, not in the form of Clan Status.\r\n\r\nCovenant Status is unique in that a character may, on occasion, have more than one form of it. This occurs almost exclusively at low levels, where a character is often beneath the notice of most other members of his covenants. A character may never have more than three dots total in Covenant Status among multiple covenants. A double-agent, for example, might take two dots worth of Covenant Status (Carthians) and a single dot of Covenant Status (Lancea Sanctum), representing the character’s true allegiance to the Carthians as well as the fact that he’s in on the ground floor of the Lancea Sanctum so that he can feed information back to his Carthian fellows. A character may even have a single dot of Covenant Status in three different covenants — perhaps he’s somewhat accomplished in each, but has yet to determine where his true loyalties lie. Naturally, a character with Status in only one Covenant is not beholden to the three-dot limit.\r\n\r\nA character with dots in Covenant Status through multiple factions does indeed gain access to those covenants’ special benefits. Covenants expect certain contributions of their members, however, and if other Kindred find out that the vampire in question plays multiple sides against the middle, he might see that Status vanish in a single night in which he’s called upon to account for his treacheries. Such is also the reason that cumulative Covenant Status is limited to three dots. By the time a character gains a certain degree of Status in a single covenant, he sticks out like a sore thumb if he turns up among another covenant’s members. (An exception to this might occur if a character is truly some sort of deep-cover agent or other mole, but that circumstance is best handled at the Storyteller’s discretion).', 'Status for Kindred society', 'VtR 102', 'vampire');

Each maneuver is a prerequisite for the next. So, your character can’t have “Duck and Weave” until he has “Body Blow.” The maneuvers and their effects are described below, most of which are based on the Brawl Skill.\r\n\r\n**Body Blow (•):** Your character can deliver powerful blows that leave opponents reeling and gasping for air.

Use the higher of your character’s Dexterity or Wits to determine his Defense when dealing with Brawl-based attacks only (not against Weaponry attacks). If a combination of Brawl- and Weaponry-based attacks is focused on your character in the same turn, use his normal Defense against both.\r\n\r\n**Combination Blows (•••):** Your character’s training and experience allow him to devastate opponents with a flurry of rapid blows. He can make two Brawl attacks against the same target in a single action.

He is too busy bobbing and weaving out of the way of attacks.\r\n\r\n**Haymaker (••••):** Your character can deliver powerful, accurate blows capable of knocking an opponent unconscious with a single punch. A single Brawl attack that equals or exceeds the target’s Size in damage might knock him unconscious. A Stamina roll is made for the victim. If it succeeds, he is conscious but he still loses his next action due to the Body Blow (see above). If it fails, he is unconscious for a number of turns equal to the damage done. \r\n**Drawback:** Your character cannot use his Defense against any attack in the same turn in which he intends to use this maneuver. If he uses Defense against attacks that occur earlier in the Initiative roster, before he can perform this maneuver, he cannot perform the maneuver in the turn. He is too busy bobbing and weaving out of the way of attacks.\r\n\r\n**Brutal Blow (•••••):** Your character’s accuracy and power are such that his fists are lethal weapons, able to injure or kill opponents. A brutal blow inflicts lethal instead of bashing damage. \r\n**Drawback:** Spend one Willpower point per attack. Note that this Willpower expenditure does not add three dice to the attack.'),

Penalties to hit specific targets are reduced by one. See “Specified Targets,” p. 165. Even when a specific part of an opponent is not targeted, armor penalties to your character’s Brawl attacks are reduced by one.\r\n\r\n**Iron Skin (••):** Your character has hardened his body to physical blows, allowing him to withstand repeated hits with minimal effect. He has an effective armor trait of 1 against bashing attacks only.\r\n\r\n**Defensive Attack (•••):** Your character has mastered the ability to fight defensively. When using this maneuver, your character gains +2 to his Defense for the turn, but any attack he makes suffers a -2 penalty. He can move no more than his Speed while performing a Defense Attack maneuver in a turn.\r\n\r\n**Whirlwind Strike (••••):** Your character can unleash a storm of blows against an opponent. He can make a number of extra Brawl attacks for each point of Dexterity that he has above 2 in a single action. Each extra at-tack is made at a cumulative -1 modifier. Thus, he can perform a total of two attacks at Dexterity 3 (the second of which is at -1), three attacks at Dexterity 4 (the third of which is at -2), and four at Dexterity 5 (the fourth of which is at -3).

So, your character can’t have “Deflect and Thrust” until he has “Whirling Blades.” The maneuvers and their effects are detailed below, all of which are based on the Weaponry Skill.\r\n\r\n**Whirling Blades (•):** Your character’s Dodge trait (Defense doubled; see p. 156) is not penalized by multiple attacks staged against him in a turn until the number of attacks exceeds his Weaponry dots, at which point each attack thereafter reduces his Dodge by -1. So, if your char- acter (with 2 Defense and 3 Weaponry) dodges attacks in a turn, the first three incoming attacks suffer his full Dodge trait as a penalty (-4).

(1, 'Envy', 'An envious person is never satisfied with what she has.\r\n\r\nNo matter her wealth, status or accomplishments, there is always someone else who seems to have more, and it’s coveted. Envious characters are never secure or content with their place in life. They always measure themselves against their rivals and look for ways to get what they deserve. They might be considered paranoid or just consumed by a self-loathing that they project onto others.\r\n\r\nYour character regains one Willpower point whenever she gains something important from a rival or has a hand in harming that rival’s wellbeing.\r\n\r\n**Example:** *Hughes watched the reporters, sponsors and women flock to Montgomery like moths to a flame. One-tenth of a second in the 40 meter and a couple slick moves on the field were all that made Hughes the low-paid fullback and Montgomery the star tailback. Now it was the big Monday-night game and the attention was all on Montgomery.*\r\n\r\n*“Drink this and you’ll be MVP tonight.”*\r\n\r\n*At first, the voice seemed to come out of nowhere, but then there he was, one of the ugliest guys Hughes had ever seen, sitting right there in the locker room, grinning like the Cheshire Cat.*\r\n\r\n*Who the hell are you? How’d you get in here?”*\r\n\r\n*“Kick-off is in five minutes, Hughes. You want to be the star tonight? Then drink up. You want Montgomery to get the headlines tomorrow, then call security.”*\r\n\r\n*Hughes considered a moment, then took the vial and downed it. Salty, thick, warm and powerful — so very powerful. Screw the consequences, he was going to have the game of his life.*\r\n\r\n*By taking the drink, Hughes indulges his defining Vice and regains one point of spent Willpower.*\r\n\r\n**Other Names:** Covetousness, jealousy, paranoia\r\n\r\n**Possessed by:** Celebrities, executives, politicians'),
(2, 'Gluttony', 'Gluttony is about indulging appetites to the exclusion of everything else. It’s about dedicating oneself to sensual pleasures or chasing the next high. A glutton makes any sacrifice to feed his insatiable appetite for pleasure, regardless of the cost to himself or those around him. He might be considered a junky or even a kleptomaniac (he steals things he doesn’t need just for the thrill of it).\r\n\r\nYour character regains one spent Willpower point whenever he indulges in his addiction or appetites at some risk to himself or a loved one.\r\n\r\n**Example:** *They’d come for his dad. They’d hauled his ass into the bedroom, brought in the power tools, and then the screaming started. James thought about protesting, but what good would it do? He decided to drown it all out, instead. He snorted some coke and tipped back the whiskey. Sure, he’d gotten involved with them, and maybe that was a mistake, but he told his dad to keep out of it. James took another drink. The whiskey trailed fire down his throat and dulled his senses. They didn’t tolerate people interfering in their business. And so, James took another drink.* \r\n\r\n*By overwhelming his senses with drugs and booze rather than helping his father, James indulges in his defining Vice and regains a point of spent Willpower.*\r\n\r\n**Other Names:** Addictive personality, conspicuous consumer, epicurean \r\n\r\n**Possessed by:** Celebrities, junkies, thieves'),
(3, 'Greed', 'Like the envious, the greedy are never satisfied with what they have. They want more — more money, a bigger house, more status or influence — no matter that they may already have more than they can possibly handle. Everything is taken to excess. To the greedy, there is no such thing as having too much. If that means snatching someone else’s hard-earned reward just to feather one’s own nest, well, that’s the way it goes.\r\n\r\nYour character regains one Willpower point whenever he acquires something at the expense of another. Gaining it must come at some potential risk (of assault, arrest or simple loss of peer respect).\r\n\r\n**Example:** *Gregor scanned down the list of names. It read like a small-town telephone book. He signed the cover sheet, ending the employment of several hundred people. “Such is the way of capitalism,” he mused. The press\r\nwouldn’t believe there was synergy to the merger unless the two companies’ duplicated human resources weren’t eliminated. Progress had its price.*\r\n\r\n*He once again skimmed the magazine list of the world’s 500 wealthiest men, and eyed the meager difference between his fortune at number 20 and that of number 19. Then he imagined next year’s poll. Progress had its rewards, too.*\r\n\r\n*By engineering the hostile takeover that costs hundreds of jobs, all for petty personal gain, Gregor indulges his defining Vice and regains a point of spent Willpower.*\r\n\r\n**Other Names:** Avarice, parsimony\r\n**Possessed by:** CEOs, lawyers, stock brokers'),
(4, 'Lust', 'The Vice of Lust is the sin of uncontrolled desire. A lusty individual is driven by a passion for something (usually sex, but it can be a craving for virtually any experience or activity) that he acts upon without consideration for the needs or feelings of others. A lusty individual uses any means at his disposal to indulge his desires, from deception to manipulation to acts of violence.\r\n\r\nYour character is consumed by a passion for something. He regains one Willpower point whenever he satisfies his lust or compulsion in a way that victimizes others.\r\n\r\n**Example:** *For two weeks, Aaron had been holed up with the star witness, “protecting” her. That she was also suspected as an accomplice in the crime hadn’t stopped Aaron from banging her seven ways to Sunday, ever since she’d come on to him on the second day. It might have meant compromising the witness and his career, but this chick was worth it. Aaron didn’t care that her last four husbands had died or that the precinct had labeled her “Black Widow.” The sex just kept getting better. In fact, he was exhausted for hours afterward. If he’d stopped to think about it, the blackouts might have worried him, but he didn’t want to think about it.*\r\n\r\n*By using his position and influence to get sexual favors, Aaron indulges in his defining Vice and regains a point of spent Willpower.*\r\n\r\n**Other Names:** Lasciviousness, impatience, impetuousness \r\n\r\n**Possessed by:** Movie producers, politicians, rock stars\r\n'),
(5, 'Pride', 'Pride is the Vice of self-confidence run amok. It is the belief that one’s every action is inherently right, even when it should be obvious that it is anything but. A prideful person refuses to back down when his decision or reputation is called into question, even when the evidence is clear that he is in the wrong. His ego does not accept any outcome that suggests fallibility, and he is willing to see others suffer rather than admit that he’s wrong.\r\n\r\nYour character regains one Willpower point whenever he exerts his own wants (not needs) over others at some potential risk to himself. This is most commonly the desire for adulation, but it could be the desire to make others do as he commands.\r\n\r\n**Example:** *Fabrice stepped out of his car and faced the old mansion. Four centuries of French weather had taken its toll on the once regal place. The setting sun stretched shadows across the façade, highlighting every flaw and crack, and throwing a distorted shadow over the front door like an evil omen.*\r\n\r\nHaunted indeed. \r\n\r\n*When the unkempt, ill-mannered student had shown up to his lecture and publicly challenged the professor to spend one night in the mansion, how could the foremost debunker of mystic nonsense decline?*\r\n\r\n*Fabrice was sure he had more to fear from the house collapsing than from evil spirits. Yes, he was quite sure.*\r\n\r\n*By refusing to back down to the challenge, and reveling in his own self-assurance, Fabrice indulges his defining Vice and regains a point of spent Willpower.*\r\n\r\n**Other Names:** Arrogance, ego complex, vanity\r\n**Possessed by:** Corporate executives, movie stars, street thugs\r\n'),
(6, 'Sloth', 'The Vice of Sloth is about avoiding work until someone else has to step in to get the job done. Rather than put in the effort — and possibly risk failure — in a difficult situation, the slothful person simply refuses to do anything, knowing that someone else will step in and fix the problem sooner or later. The fact that people might needlessly suffer while the slothful person sits on his thumbs doesn’t matter one bit.\r\n\r\nYour character regains one Willpower point whenever he successfully avoids a difficult task but achieves the same goal nonetheless.\r\n\r\n**Example:** *Catherine pretended to listen as the fourth tenant that day called to tell her, the superintendent, that the security lights were out. Some asshole had gone and broken all the lights around the apartment building.*\r\n\r\n*Sure, she’d heard stories about the Harcourt building, where the lights were shattered one night and there were break-ins the next. Depending on who was telling the story, some weird shit happened over there.*\r\n\r\n*But the afternoon soaps were starting, and Catherine decided the Harcourt stuff was just rumors. Besides, she had a baseball bat in case any boogey men came calling. She unplugged the phone and let her ass warm the couch. The lights could wait another day.*\r\n\r\n*By avoiding work despite the repercussions, Catherine indulges her defining Vice and regains a point of spent Willpower.*\r\n\r\n**Other Names:** Apathy, cowardice, ignorance\r\n \r\n**Possessed by:** Couch potatoes, trust-fund heirs, welfare cheats'),
(7, 'Wrath', 'The Vice of Wrath is the sin of uncontrolled anger. The wrathful look for ways to vent their anger and frustration on people or objects at the slightest provocation. In most cases the reaction is far out of proportion to the perceived slight. A wrathful person cut off on the freeway might try to force another driver off the road, or a wrathful cop might delight in beating each and every person he arrests, regardless of the offense.\r\n\r\nYour character regains one spent Willpower point whenever he unleashes his anger in a situation where doing so is dangerous. If the fight has already begun, no Willpower points are regained. It must take place in a situation where anger is unwarranted or inappropriate.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Example:** *As April staggered in, Rebecca surprised her at the door, demanding the month’s rent. April had gotten hooked on the new drug that had hit the streets. She had spent most of her time day-tripping and having paranoia attacks about “things eating through the walls of the world.” Rebecca didn’t care anymore, and when the usual litany of excuses began, Rebecca hit her. Blood ran from April’s nose and down her mouth.*\r\n\r\n*“I want... the damn... rent,” Rebecca yelled, punctuating each statement with another blow until April was on the ground, balled up and crying.* \r\n\r\n*By beating the money out of April, Rebecca indulges her defining Vice and regains a point of spent Willpower.*\r\n\r\n**Other Names:** Antisocial tendencies, hot-headedness, poor anger management, sadism\r\n\r\n**Possessed by:** Bullies, drill sergeants, street thugs');

A charitable character is guided by her compassion to share what she has in order to improve the plight of those around her. Charitable individuals are guided by the principle of treating others as they would be treated themselves. By sharing gifts and taking on the role of the Samaritan, they hope to cultivate goodwill in others, and the gifts they give will eventually return to them in their hour of need.\r\n\r\nYour character regains all spent Willpower points whenever she helps another at the risk of loss or harm to herself. It isn’t enough to share what your character has in abundance. She must make a real sacrifice in terms of time, possessions or energy, or she must risk life and limb to help another.\r\n\r\n**Example:** *Deloris could see her dad losing his mind if he knew his little girl was driving around a south-side neighborhood so late at night. But if she wanted to be a top investigative reporter, she had to take some risks, even if it meant tracking down clues on a serial killer in a slum.*\r\n\r\n*She’d been the one to dub him “Tommy 10 Tongues” in her first cover story. Now he was up to 12 tongues, and she was determined to catch him before he harvested another. She knew the police had no idea how to decipher the bloody hieroglyphs at the crime scenes, or why the victims were all missing their tongues. But the police didn’t have an ex-lover who was a linguistics professor.*\r\n\r\n*Then Deloris passed the other motorist. A white man with a cast on one arm struggling to change a flat. If Tommy 10 Tongues didn’t get him, the locals surely would. And yet, Deloris wasn’t born yesterday. The cast could have been a fake. The killer could have used such tricks to lure his victims in. She didn’t want to be the next one, but she couldn’t bear the thought of writing the morning headline, “Stranded Motorist 13th Victim.” So, she pulled over to do the charitable thing.*\r\n\r\n*Deloris gains all spent Willpower for her act of charity. Her willingness to risk herself for someone else validates her defining Virtue.*\r\n\r\n**Other Names:** Compassion, mercy \r\n\r\n**Possessed by:** Philanthropists, saints, soup-kitchen workers'),
(2, 'Faith', 'Those with Faith know that the universe is not random, meaningless chaos, but ordered by a higher power. No matter how horrifying the world might be, everything has its place in the Plan and ultimately serves that Purpose. This Virtue does not necessarily involve belief in a personified deity. It might involve belief in a Grand Unified Theory whereby the seeming randomness of the universe is ultimately an expression of mathematical precision. Or it might be a view that everything is One and that even evil is indistinguishable from good when all discriminating illusions are overcome.\r\n\r\nYour character regains all spent Willpower points whenever he is able to forge meaning from chaos and tragedy.\r\n\r\n**Example:** *Kevin stood at a precipice. Images flashed through his mind: his wife’s bulging eyes, his son’s mutilated body, his daughter’s pink pajamas shredded and matted with hair and blood. Despair and rage whirled up from the psychological chasm before him. He had only to take a step into the cold comfort that the world was meaningless, random and violent, that there could be no God if such evil could come to pass.*\r\n\r\n*No! He didn’t believe it. He couldn’t believe it. Something had done this. Something sick and twisted. Something inhuman. Kevin would find it.

(3, 'Fortitude', 'A person’s ideals are meaningless unless they’re tested. When it seems as though the entire world is arrayed against him because of his beliefs, a person possessing Fortitude weathers the storm and emerges with his convictions intact. Fortitude is about standing up for one’s beliefs and holding the course no matter how tempting it may be to relent or give up. By staying the course — regardless of the cost — he proves the worth of his ideals.\r\n\r\nYour character regains all spent Willpower points whenever he withstands overwhelming or tempting pressure to alter his goals. This does not include temporary distractions from his course of action, only pressure that might cause him to abandon or change his goals altogether.\r\n\r\n**Example:** *Noel was absorbed in reading the newspaper when the stranger walked in. The town was opening its eyes to the corruption; his campaign to oust the criminal who called himself ‘mayor’ was working.*\r\n\r\n*The stranger dropped some photos on the desk, breaking Noel’s concentration. They were of Noel 15 years before. The alcoholic years. “I suggest you drop your high and mighty crusade unless you want these on the front page.” Noel instantly recognized that his political career hung in the balance. Was this how it started? Was this how they got their hooks into you?*\r\n\r\n*“Run them,” he said. “I don’t care. You can tell your boss he’s through. He has more to lose than I do.”*\r\n\r\n*By refusing to budge and pressing on in the wake of scandal, Noel behaves in a way that validates his defining Virtue and he regains any spent Willpower points.*\r\n\r\n**Other Names:** Courage, integrity, mettle, stoicism\r\n\r\n**Possessed by:** Dictators, fanatic cultists, gumshoes'),
(4, 'Hope', 'Being hopeful means believing that evil and misfortune cannot prevail, no matter how grim things become. Not only do the hopeful believe in the ultimate triumph of morality and decency over malevolence, they maintain steadfast belief in a greater sense of cosmic justice — whether it’s Karma or the idea of an all-knowing, all-seeing God who waits to punish the wicked. All will turn out right in the end, and the hopeful mean to be around when it happens.\r\n\r\nYour character regains all spent Willpower points whenever she refuses to let others give in to despair, even though doing so risks harming her own goals or wellbeing. This is similar to Fortitude, above, except that your character tries to prevent others from losing hope in their goals. She need not share those goals herself or even be successful in upholding them, but there must be a risk involved.\r\n\r\n**Example:** *The activists’ anger was palpable as Eva entered the room.*\r\n\r\n*“I know you see me as the enemy — Trent Thorson’s daughter. The truth is, I may own Thorson Lumber, but I don’t control it or I’d shut it down.

There’s something there, something bigger than any of us that needs to be protected.*\r\n\r\n*“All I came here to say is don’t lose hope.

(5, 'Justice', 'Wrongs cannot go unpunished. This is the central tenet of the just, who believe that protecting the innocent and confronting inequity is the responsibility of every decent person, even in the face of great personal danger. The just believe that evil cannot prosper so long as one good person strives to do what is right, regardless of the consequences.\r\n\r\nYour character regains all spent Willpower points whenever he does the right thing at risk of personal loss or setback. The “right thing” can be defined by the letter or spirit of a particular code of conduct, whether it be the United States penal code or a biblical Commandment.\r\n\r\n**Example:** *For five years Malcolm watched the bastard parade into court, smiling through appeal after appeal. His gold-plated lawyers ran circles around the district attorney. Then they settled the class-action suit at such a ridiculously low payment that Malcolm had to wonder how far the bribes went. And the bastard was going free.*\r\n\r\n*Hundreds had been driven insane by the drug he distributed. It made him rich even while it made Malcolm’s sister a corpse... and then a ghost. It was only then that Malcolm realized why she always appeared outside his hall closet. That’s where he kept his gun.*\r\n\r\n*If Malcolm takes the law into his own hands and makes himself a criminal as a result, he acts in a way that validates his defining Virtue and he regains any spent Willpower.*\r\n\r\n**Other Names:** Condemnatory, righteous\r\n\r\n**Possessed by:** Critics, judges, parents, role models'),
(6, 'Prudence', 'The Virtue of Prudence places wisdom and restraint above rash action and thoughtless behavior. One maintains integrity and principles by moderating actions and avoiding unnecessary risks. While that means a prudent person might never take big gambles that bring huge rewards, neither is his life ruined by a bad roll of the dice. By choosing wisely and avoiding the easy road he prospers slowly but surely.\r\n\r\nYour character regains all spent Willpower points whenever he refuses a tempting course of action by which he could gain significantly. The “temptation” must involve some reward that, by refusing it, might cost him later on.\r\n\r\n**Example:** *“Miss Hernandez, you’re an intelligent woman — and a beautiful one, I might add. There are so many benefits available to the people who contribute to our family business. The least of them is the considerable fee we’re offering for your services in this matter.”*\r\n\r\n*“Your offer is generous,” Louise replied, “and I thank you for it. But the types of offshore transactions you propose are tantamount to money laundering and tax evasion. It wouldn’t be prudent for me to jeopardize my legal career by being party to this.”*\r\n\r\n*“You think you know, Miss Hernandez, but I assure you, you have no idea what you’re passing up.”*\r\n\r\n*If Louise passes on the possibility of riches to preserve her job and name, she acts in a way that validates her defining Virtue and regains any spent Willpower.*\r\n\r\n**Other Names:** Patience, vigilance\r\n**Possessed by:** Businessmen, doctors, priests, scientists'),
(7, 'Temperance', 'Moderation in all things is the secret to happiness, so says the doctrine of Temperance. It’s all about balance. Everything has its place in a person’s life, from anger to forgiveness, lust to chastity. The temperate do not believe in denying their urges, as none of it is unnatural or unholy. The trouble comes when things are taken to excess, whether it’s a noble or base impulse. Too much righteousness can be just as bad as too much wickedness.\r\n\r\nYour character regains all spent Willpower when he resists a temptation to indulge in an excess of any behavior, whether good or bad, despite the obvious rewards it might offer.\r\n\r\n**Example:** *Michael pressed Ravera to the pavement and cuffed him. For half his years on the force, Michael had been trying to bring Douglas Ravera to justice.*\r\n\r\n*How many kids had died from Ravera’s peddled junk? How many times had Michael’s family received death threats? How many times had Ravera been collared only to walk on a technicality?*\r\n\r\n*Michael’s mind kept turning back to the unregistered .38 stashed in his patrol car. He could fire some rounds into the car door and put Ravera’s prints on the weapon. Who would doubt that Michael had to kill him in self-defense?*\r\n\r\n*“No,” Michael muttered to himself. He couldn’t lower himself to the same level as this criminal, no matter how tempting. He’d be no better. Instead, he hauled Ravera into the back of the car and slammed the door.*\r\n\r\n*By refusing to give in to extreme and compelling impulses, remaining centered instead, Michael acts in a way that validates his defining Virtue and he regains any spent Willpower.*\r\n\r\n**Other Names:** Chastity, even-temperament, frugality\r\n**Possessed by:** Clergy, police officers, social workers');
