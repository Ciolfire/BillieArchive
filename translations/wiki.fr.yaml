  title: Attributs
  description: "People have the inherent capacity to act, behave and think. We can perform actions and have intuitive talents such as running, theorizing and persuading others. So does your character. His basic, fundamental capabilities are represented with Attributes, which are the foundation of all the acts that he performs. These traits are classified into three categories — Mental, Physical and Social — and are rolled to determine how well your character accomplishes efforts in the game. Mental Attributes suggest how insightful, clever and determined your character is. They are Intelligence, Wits and Resolve. Physical Attributes indicate how strong, graceful and enduring your character is. They are Strength, Dexterity and Stamina. Social Attributes determine how imposing, magnetic and dignified your character is. They are Presence, Manipulation and Composure. The Attributes of ordinary people are rated from 1 to 5. It’s possible for someone to have more dots, but these individuals are typically beyond the human ken, partially or fully a part of the mysterious supernatural world. Perhaps they’re touched by spirits or born to a legacy of service to unseen beings. Your character, even as a mortal human, automatically starts with one dot in each Attribute. These dots are already filled in on your character sheet. When your character performs an action, the Attribute most appropriate to the effort is referenced. If he tries to remember what he read during library research last week, you look to his Intelligence dots. If he tries to jump a chasm, you check his Strength. If he tries to make a good first impression on a group of people, you apply his Presence score. Your character’s dots are usually rolled as part of a dice pool. Attributes are sometimes combined and rolled to see if an action can be accomplished, but they are more often combined with Skills. The Storyteller will tell you what Attributes are applicable to your character’s actions, and what rolls you can make. In general, the three classes of Attributes are used based on the circumstances. One of each of the Mental, Physical and Social traits has bearing on a different kind of action, as outlined in the boxed text."
