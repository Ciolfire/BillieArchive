The spell then applies to anyone or anything in that radius or volume, friend or foe. The mage cannot single out specific targets within the declared space.
      Advanced Area-Affecting: If the mage has dots in the spell’s primary Arcanum that are one or more higher than normally required to cast the spell, he can increase the radius or defined volume by more dramatic steps."
