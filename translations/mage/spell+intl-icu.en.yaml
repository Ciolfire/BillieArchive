  duration:
    label: Duration
    description: "There are four types of spell Duration: lasting, concentration, transitory and prolonged. The spell descriptions provided later in this chapter list each spell’s Duration."

    lasting:
      label: Lasting
      description: |
        A lasting spell’s effect is a natural part of reality; it has no defined Duration, since it persists as long as it is natural for it to. For example, a spell that sets a target on fire is lasting. The fire is real and continues to burn normally until it is put out or there’s nothing left to burn.
        The target’s injuries are also real and must heal normally. Likewise, a spell that heals injuries is lasting. The healing restores the target to its natural state, so wounds do not re-appear when the spell ends.

        Concentration-based, transitory and prolonged spells all create an unnatural effect, such as transforming someone’s shape. Their effects end once the spell’s Duration expires. That is, reality restores things to normal. Spells with a lasting Duration do not count against the maximum number of spells a mage can maintain (based on his Gnosis).
    concentration:
      label: Concentration
      description: |
        A concentration-based spell’s Duration is as long as the mage applies mental effort to keep it going. The mage cannot take any other action, except for simple movement (up to his Speed; he cannot run). The mage also receives no Defense against attacks, although he can seek cover from ranged attacks. If the mage is attacked, a reflexive Resolve + Composure roll must be made for him to maintain concentration.

        If the mage stops concentrating for any reason, voluntarily or not, the spell ends. The exception is if he decides to add Duration factors as if it were a transitory spell (see below) before the spell is cast, in which case the spell lasts for an additional time equal to its assigned Duration, and then lapses. The mage cannot start concentrating on a spell again once he has stopped, even if the spell hasn’t lapsed yet. Note: A mage cannot use a concentration-based Duration when casting aimed spells (see “Aimed Spells,”).
    transitory:
      label: Transitory
      description: A transitory spell’s default Duration is one turn.

  area:
    label: Area
    description: |
      Instead of one or more specified targets, a spell might affect a circular radius around a specified spot (radiating equaling in all directions), or a defined volume (measured in three dimensions — width, length and height — defined by the spellcaster). The spell then applies to anyone or anything in that radius or volume, friend or foe. The mage cannot single out specific targets within the declared space.
      Advanced: If the mage has dots in the spell’s primary Arcanum that are one or more higher than normally required to cast the spell, he can increase the radius or defined volume by more dramatic steps.
