      A character can push this duration of effect (whether by the human host’s own choice or by the demon wresting control), continuing it indefinitely, but doing so is bad for the mind, body and soul. It is in this way that a Possessed character may suffer Burnout — see Burnout, p. 147.}

  setup: |
    You choose Vestments based upon the dot ratings you placed in Vice.
    For each dot in a Vice, you gain one Vestment in accordance with that dot ranking.

    Vestments, like the Vice ratings, are delimited by Innate (1-dot), Lesser (2-dot) and Greater (3-dot) powers.

  setup: | 
    You begin with 3 dots to distribute across all seven Vices.
    Your character may never have more dots in another Vice than those dots possessed in that primary Vice.
