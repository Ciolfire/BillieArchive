    Gear is typically rated 1 to 5 in terms of quality, and that number of dice is added to your dice pools when pertinent actions are performed.
    Generally speaking, useful but simple items and tools offer a +1 bonus.
    Most specially made gear that's designed and fabricated for a particular purpose is rated +2. Say, a slimjim for auto theft.
    Tools at +3 are reliable and precise.
    Tools rated +4 and +5 are top-of-the-line, craftsman-made and probably expensive devices.
    Equipment created or altered by supernatural or advanced means can be rated +4 or +5 (or higher!).
